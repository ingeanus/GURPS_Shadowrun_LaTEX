	\textbf{\section{Metatypes}}
\end{section_header}

\begin{multicols*}{3}
	
	In the Sixth World, humanity has awakened a variety of differing subspecies, generally collectively referred to as Metatypes and Metahumans collectively. A wide variety of these are available to players, ranging from the 'mundane' Human or Elf, to the more outlandish Nartaki or Oni. Alongside this, a number of sapient Critters known as Metasapients are available for players, such as Pixies and Sasquatch.
	
	\subsection{Unusually-Sized Metatypes}\label{metatype_sizing}
	
	Many metatypes are of an unusual size compared to standard humans, generally ranging from SM+2 to SM-1. This can have some interesting considerations to account for, largely in equipment sizing and cost alongside Cost of Living.
	
	If a character tries to us items meant for SM different from his own, the GM should assess a penalty - usual equal to the difference in SM, however it can rarely be more for items \textit{very highly} dependant on their sizing. If the items either has/lacks size adjustments (e.g. a troll using a firearm lacking larger grips and trigger guards), apply this penalty as well. For some equipment, there is not roll to use it, meaning the penalties should be applied elsewhere; often this is armor and clothing, in which apply the \textit{My Armor Doesn't Fit!} rules from Low-Tech 103, alongside assessing reaction penalties as necessary (e.g. a gangster might not mind such an attire, while a civilian would).
	
	For metatypes \textbf{larger} than humans, this results in purely increased prices - driven by lower supply, higher material cost, cultural differences (\textit{cough racism cough}), and  more difficult engineering designs. For SM higher than 0, follow the HT10 rules on \textit{Adjusting for SM}.
	
	These increases don't apply evenly accross all fields and are best left to the GM to decide, however a good list is as follows: All armour and clothing alongside everything meant to cover a large surface area of the metahuman, any gear that needs to be scaled up for the metahuman to use it properly - without negatively affecting its purpose (e.g. a terminal for a keyboard does, but a physical lockpick will not because it needs to fit SM 0 equivalent doors!), and cost of living (Increased food requirements, more expensive housing, and so on).
	
	Some equipment only partially falls into such categories! Such equipment usually have a function that is not dependent on size, but would be negatively impacted by its user being larger than normal. In such cases, take the increase in cost/weight/etc and divide it by 5 (e.g. SM+1 is $\times$2 cost, so 1 + 1/5 = $\times$1.2 costs). Again, the GM should make a ruling here, but a healthy list is: All firearms (Larger and stronger grips and stocks), most melee weapons (Adjusted grips and guards), many vehicles (Larger cabins and doors, adjusted heights, changes to account for passenger weight), and so on.
	
	Keep in mind that this latter option \textit{does not raise the SM of the item}. While it does remove and SM related penalties for its operation, the items does not gain any other benefits associated with a larger size; melee weapons do not gain higher damage, small arms do not fire larger bullets or have longer barrels, so on.
	
	Keep in mind that some equipment might not be able to ever be scaled! This usually occurs because the equipment needs to be at a certain SM, but its controlling mechanisms cannot be scaled up without affecting its operations. A possible example of this are physical lockpicks, which need to be built for normal doors, but increasing their SM for a troll to properly operate them would prevent them from fitting in a normal lock! In all such cases, the differing SM penalty always applies, but the GM should keep an open mind to alternative solution (e.g. perhaps adding large external portions to the lockpick that can be held, while keeping their tips at normal size).
	
	Low-Tech Companion 2 p21 can be used to scale melee weapons to differing SM, however it's normally used for cinematic games and should usually be avoided in favor or simply taking larger weapons! While a greatsword does still need unorthodox grips and handguards (It's still built for humans normally), its base ST, reach, and capabilities are much more favorable to large metatypes. There's not really rules for larger firearms other than - buy a bigger gun; raising an SMG from 9mm CLP to 7.62 CL is simply making it into a rifle after all!
	
	For smaller metatypes this is a somewhat different story. While they do benefit from decreased material costs, they are still handicapped by lower supply, racism, and so on. Additionally, their proportions are often quite different from teenage or young individuals for larger metatypes, meaning they cannot simply purchase items marketed towards those individuals (At least, if they expect things to fit properly).
	
	In such cases, follow the table below:
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
			\hline
			SM & Cost & Weight \& Power \\
			\hline
			\hline
			-1 & $\times1.7$ & $\times1/2$ \\
			-2 & $\times4.04$ & $\times1/5$ \\
			-3 & $\times8.02$ & $\times1/10$ \\
			-4 & $\times16.01$ & $\times1/20$ \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}

	\begin{center}
		For extending the table, follow these guidelines: Weight follows the HT10 rules of \textit{Adjusting for SM}. Cost is equal to:\\ $4/5\times(SMM)\,+\,1/5\times\frac{1}{SMM}$
	\end{center}
	
	Where SMM is the multiplier for SM based on HT 10.
	
	In said formula, SM reduced material cost (20\% via B474), however the reverse applies to labor, increasing the remaining 80\%.
	
	\subsection{Metahumans}
	
	Metahumanity serves as the prevalent — albeit debatably dominant — species on the planet, with a wide variety of subspecies and variants. Metahumans serve as the most common and original subspecies humans split off into during the Awakening.

	\subsection{Metasapients}
	
	Metaspaients are non-human sapient creatures, such as Centaur or Naga. They're just as intelligent (for the most part) as any person you'll find on the street, although that doesn't mean that they necessarily think the exact same way! Lesser Centaurs for example, are cast out by their tribe for looking part human, and only a few of them will still willingly interact with human society to survive.
	
	While much of the templates in this book are tuned to be close to their original game stats and lore descriptions, metasapients are a hard departure from this. Many of them would have extraordinarily strange stats compared to their (presumed) non-awakened counterparts. Once again, a prime example of this is the Lesser Centaur, who should end up with something close to a ST 14 racial average based on Shadowrun's statistics, however horses have 22-25 ST in \GURPS (And with good reason, you will die if a horse kicks you!).
	
	Many metasapients have negative Appearance levels, following the Fantasy p128  rules on Appearance; these modifiers are meant to apply to the dominant race in the setting - metahumanity. Between their own species, they have perfectly normal Appearance levels! If one wishes to have mixed levels (e.g. a Centaur that is Ugly to humans but Attractive to his own kind), either make a meta-trait of all the Appearance traits or use the \textit{Universal, +25\%} enhancement to apply to both metahumanity and metasapients.

	Building an Artificial Intelligence character is an \textit{extremely involved} process. Due to their eclectic combination of traits, they end up becoming very expensive characters that are not as intuitive to build as others. As such, it's highly recommended that GMs do not let the faint of heart attempt creating these. Much of the systems for these characters are drawn from \GURPS Transhuman Space, so please do give that a read if you are considering this.
	
	If an AI wishes to have a corporeal body to interact with the physical world, they must buy one separately, and the GM must make some decisions. When allowing AI characters, the GM must decide on one of two options, with the recommended one being the latter:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Points: } The AI must pay the full point price for their \textit{most expensive body}, even if they are in a less expensive body most of the time. Additional bodies are bought as an Ally with the Minion enhancement, and a Puppet or Puppet Group. Most drones can be bought without Pilot Programs, giving them no mental scores, and dropping Ally costs massively. 
		
		As well, more granular ally costs from Social Engineering p42 are recommended, especially for bodies with large negative costs. These bodies will often have a FoA of Constant, unless for some reason they are not available at any given time. 
		
		This option tends to make AIs extremely expensive, as robot bodies tend to be well over 60 points, and can leave AI with little in the way of spare points. However, it keeps the power levels relatively equal among AI and non-AI characters. 
		
		Conversely, it can be unfair to charge AI points for their computers, cars, etc. simply because they have the Possession advantage (Especially since that advantage should cover the cost itself!) - a rigger can accomplish many of the same things as the AI can, but with money!
		
		\item \textbf{Money: } The AI must only pay points for bodies that are unavailable to an average runner. No buying Mitsuhama's classified combat anthro-drone with cash! Otherwise, they pay for their bodies with money, as does anybody else, alongside upgrades. They will still need to stat out their bodies, however these are only for game purposes. 
		
		GMs should be wary of characters using this to eek out additional options on their bodies with limited cost (Such as deciding on their lonesome that their drone is rugged and has 12 HT). 
		
		This tends to make AI somewhat more powerful (Least of all because they require high Wealth in order to play \textit{at all}, however such feats are not impossible for a similar rigger or decker. 
		
		The GM should consider loosening restrictions on Wealth (As for Deckers and Riggers), alongside allowing the AI to consider stock drone or computers for Settled lifestyle items, as they are in many ways their domiciles (Although they should not forget that they will still require a house to store many of these things, or suffer HT loss through decay!).
		
		It's not entirely unfair to attempt a middleground option that has AI paying points for their main (or most expensive) body, and money for all others. However, this option tends more towards acquiring all the negatives of both alongside little of their positives.
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	Some traits are split between the AI and the robot/computer body. This is generally just a quirk of Transhuman Space allowing AI to inhabit biological cybershells. This may cause some small point differentials in cases where multiple bodies are owned, so feel free to move some traits between the AIs and the bodies.
	
	AI are limited by the complexity of systems that they reside on (This is the Taboo Trait (Complexity limited IQ).), which restricts them to systems with a complexity of at least half their IQ. If the system does not have the necessary power, the AI can run at extremely slow speeds compared to their normal, lowering their IQ to the system's maximum possible while on it. Not that this does contradict UT25, which is good, because those estimates are insanely high (Complexity 9 for a human brainscan!?) and contradicted by later articles!
	
	This does mean that most AI will be limited to running on Microframes - and sometimes expensive Microframes or Mainframes - if they wish to keep their full IQ. GMs who find this deviates too far from original Shadowrun, can apply a modifier to the restriction (as seen in Ultratech p25, although in the opposite direction), making it IQ/2-1 or less. Alternatively, the Matrix is often characterized as a highly distributed network of processing power, meaning that it could be justified that the Matrix picks up the slack when running an AI due to its unique nature.
	
	AI \textit{must buy computers that they can run on.} This means that, if they run on a laptop, they \textit{must buy that as a body.} If they run on a mainframe, \textit{they must buy that as a body as well.} These rules work exactly like robot bodies, because computers are literally just really restricted robot bodies.
	
	AI \textit{do have DX scores}, representing their programming's overall precision when operating components. This is the same as pilot programs, which have their own DX scores based on their rating. When in physical bodies, the body itself also provides a modifier to its DX, representing the body's own capabilities. Wherever necessary, an AIs DX is a mental attribute, not a physical one.
	
	AI \textit{do not have ST or HT scores, including their derivative traits.} These traits are determined by the computer or robot the AI is running on. Do note, that computers do not have ST scores themselves, which is generally not an issue due to most instances requiring ST choose between ST or HT. However, some instances are dependant on ST, such as Knockback (B378). Those instances usually have specific rules stating what to do in those cases, e.g. Knockback says to use HP instead of ST for things like walls.
	
	Do note that AI do note take any electrical or hardware related advantages or disadvantages, those are left to the bodies. They can take software related ones as normal, which many mental disadvantages can easily serve as.
	
	For AIs that run on distributed systems, do not forget to include themselves among the programs, which can greatly limit the available program space on the network.
	
	AIs may also buy a number of normally impossible traits due to their digital nature, however the GM should feel free to limit these as they see fit:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep 0pt
		\item Enhanced Time Sense [45]. Provides the AI with extreme perception speeds by increasing the processing of visual data past biological limitations. This includes all of the normal benefits found on B52 and also includes the benefits of the Stop Motion advantage from \GURPS Powers Enhanced Sense p30\footnote{Stop Motion details the mechanical benefits of ETS' high perception speed. It lets you read text at IQx25 word per second, before speed reading. It provides a +5 (as if taking the maximum Extra Time) to any purely perception based tasks or skill, including Observation, Body Language, Connoisseur, Lip Reading, and Tracking.}
		\item Computer Brain [6 + 4/pt]. Lets you download skills and run them as programs, similarly to skillsofts. The GM should usually restrict this to 6-8 points per slot or less.
		\item Compartmentalized Mind (No Mental Separation, -20\%) [40]. By running subroutines and daemons, an AI can massively increase their mental speed, allowing for additional mental maneuvers. The GM should usually restrict this to 1 or 2 levels.

	\subsubsection*{Variants}
	
	Not all computers are made alike. These are a number of variants that can be used to further refine the computer body. 
	
	As well, the computer may be modified using the \GURPS Ultratech section Customizing Hardware (UT23), which affects cost as normal. However, you must take into account how these might also influence statistics (Such as Compact likely lowering HP and SM). Some useful references are B558 for calculating HP from weight and B550 for SM for boxy objects.
	
	\textit{Camera:} While most computers have some form of camera attached to them, they are not default on Ultratech computers, remove Blind [-50] and Injury Tolerance (No Eyes) [5], and add One Eye [-15] unless the camera is designed to perceive depth (Or is set in binocular). Certain cameras may not be high quality or might be highly specialized, add Bad Sight[-25]\footnote{See Visual Impairment from Powers: Enhanced Senses p12 for more Bad Sight varieties.} and/or Restricted Vision [-15/-30] as well.
	
	\textit{Microphone:} While most computers also have microphones, they are not default on Ultratech computers, remove Deafness [-20]. Some microphones are low quality or highly specialized, add Hard of Hearing [-10] instead.
	
	\textit{Case Sensors:} Some valuable computers have pressure and tactile sensors that can alert owners about various situations, remove Numb [-20].
	
	\textit{Speakers:} Many computers, often larger ones, do not have speakers for audio. They can still make beeps and such, for diagnostic purposes which is the Cannot Speak [-15] disadvantage. If it has proper speakers, remove Cannot Speak [-15]. In some cases, the speakers are not high quality or optimized for speech, which can be Disturbing Voice [-10] instead. Certain low-quality computers cannot even make diagnostic beeps, replace Cannot Speak [-15] with Cannot Speak [-20].
	
	\textit{Rugged:} Some computers have better core designs and durability, for these cases simply buy up higher HT. A usual value is HT 12.
	
	\textit{Megaframe:} Insanely powerful computers the size of entire buildings, that could possibly run entire countries. Change SM to SM+7 [0] (Although it can easily vary). Change Complexity to Complexity 9 Hardware [0]. Increase cost to 10,000,000¥. Increase HP to +136 [272]. They often also include a large amount of upgrades due to their value.
	
	\textit{Macroframe:} Giant, extremely power computers usually used to run entire government systems. Change SM to SM+5 [0]. Change Complexity to Complexity 8 Hardware [0]. Increase cost to 1,000,000¥. Increase HP to +64 [128]. They often also include a large amount of upgrades due to their value.
	
	\textit{Mainframe:} Large, powerful computer body. Change SM to SM+3 [0]. Change Complexity to Complexity 7 Hardware [0]. Increase cost to 100,000¥. Increase HP to +30 [60]. Will often have additional upgrades.
	
	\textit{Personal Computer:} A laptop or small desktop sized computer. Change SM to SM-2 [0]. Change Complexity to Complexity 5 Hardware [0]. Reduce cost to 1,000¥. Decrease HP to +7 [14].
	
	\textit{Small Computer:} A small, wearable computer, the size of a notebook. Change SM to SM-4 [0]. Change Complexity to Complexity 4 Hardware [0]. Reduce cost to 100¥. Decrease HP to +3 [6].
	
	\textit{Tiny Computer:} Miniscule computer, usually a tiny part of gadgets or microtech.. Change SM to SM-10 [0]. Change Complexity to Complexity 3 Hardware [0]. Reduce cost to 10¥. Decrease HP to +1 [2].
