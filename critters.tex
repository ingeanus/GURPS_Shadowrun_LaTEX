\section{Critters}

\begin{multicols*}{3}
	
	\subsection{What is a Critter}
	
	Critter is a broad term in Shadowrun, that technically means any non-human fauna, but is more often used to refer to Awakened fauna and sometimes Emerged fauna.
	
	\subsection{Awakened Critter Powers}
	
	Critter powers act in many ways like spells, however they majorly differ in the fact that they lack drain. Critter powers are usually able to be used as much as the user wishes, which makes them quite powerful and expensive.
	
	They are usually unavailable to most characters, being limited to magical creatures or individuals afflicted with special magical effects or diseases, such as the Bestow power or HMHVV.
	
	\subsubsection{Common Traits}\label{cp_ct}
	
	Many critter powers have some common setups that can be listed under a group of modifiers:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep 0pt
		\item Direct Power, +245\%: \textit{Malediction, LoS, +250\%; No Signature, +20\%; Sense-Based, Reversed, Vision \& Touch, -15\%; Substantial Only, -10\%}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Accident}\label{accident}
	\begin{flushright}
		39 Points
	\end{flushright}
	
	The critter causes seemingly normal accidents to occur around the the target. The critter rolls Will+Magic vs. the target's Per; success gives the target the Unluckiness disadvantage for minutes equal to margin of victory. If the margin of victory is 5 ore more, or the target rolls a critical failure, they are also Cursed for minutes equal to margin of victory.
	
	Unluckiness provides a single, not directly lethal way that the target will be screwed over with during the timeframe. This can be anything that is remotely plausible, from arbitrarily missing a vital die roll, to weapons breaking, to enemies showing up at the worst time, etc. If unsure, the GM can always treat this as the reverse of Lucky, making the target roll thrice and take the worst for an important roll - although they are entirely within their right to consider the roll an automatic failure instead. As well, whenever anything wrong could happen to someone on the target's team, it will happen to them.
	
	Cursed is much more lethal. Like its cousin Unluckiness, whenever something wrong happens, it \textit{always} affects the target. Whenever something good happens it \textit{always} misses the target. For the timeframe, the GM should be pernicious if not outright hostile to the target. If something remotely plausible could hose them, it should. Guns should refuse to work, everyday accidents should happen repeatedly if they can fit inside the timeframe, the GM should call for re-rolls or outright failures to rolls, or anything else, or a combination of them all (A very likely occurrence!). This is truly a \textit{-75 points disadvantage in a minute long timeframe}, and the target should \textit{earn those points with prejudice.}
	
	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{Statistics: Affliction (Based On (Per), +20\%; \hyperref[cp_ct]{Direct Power, +245\%}; Disadvantage, Unluckiness, +10\%; Disadvantage, Cursed, Side-Effect, +15\%; Magical, -10\%) [38]}}
	
	
	\subsubsection{Animal Control}\label{animal_control}
	\begin{flushright}
		25/50/75 Points
	\end{flushright}
	
	The critter has the ability to influence the behaviour of other non-sapient animals. This power affects all animals withing a 2 yard radius of a point, allowing them to control entire swarms of smaller animals. To do so, roll a Quick Contest of the critter's IQ+Magic vs the highest Will of the group.
	
	\textcolor{NavyBlue}{\textit{Modifiers: Long-Distance Modifiers to the furthest subject, -1 per slave already under control, +2 for concentrating a full minute, or +4 for concentrating a full hour.}}
	
	If the critter wins, the animals will obey the every command of it for as long as it concentrates \textit{or the animals leave the critter's line of sight}, and for minutes afterwards equal to margin of victory. The critter can only give them commands that are relatively normal behaviour for the animals (such as a flock of birds following or attacking something, not using a pistol or stealing a motorcycle), and the animals themselves perform the task as they best see fit - which can often have unpredictable results due to their low IQ.
	
	If the critter is incapacited or forces them to do something against their "principles" (e.g. making a flock of birds fight each other, or a rat avoid a free meal), roll another Quick Contest. If the animal wins, they break free.
	
	If the critter loses any Quick Contest, they are unable to affect these animals for 24 hours, and they also feel a mental coercion coming from the critter, which can make certain territorial animals attack!
	
	Critters with higher Magic can affect extremely large areas, allowing for truly \textit{massive} swarms of animals to be under their control. \textit{Fear the Force 12 Rat Spirit and its army of vermin!}

	\subsubsection{Binding}\label{binding}
	\begin{flushright}
		3.3/3.9 Points per Level
	\end{flushright}
	
	This power is somewhat different than the original Shadowrun one, which covered a \textit{very wide} array of any ability that could bind something to something else (Whether it be sticky grapple, binding attack, or sticky climbing). This power is the ability to grapple and opponent with some sort of substance either shot by the critter (sticky webbing) or found in the environment (grappling with the earth).
	
	The power is an attack with Range 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Rcl 1. On a successful hit, the target is grappled, meaning they cannot Move or Change Posture and are at -4 DX. 
	
	The binding itself has a ST equal to the levels of the power. It can also be continuously applied, adding +1 ST per additional layer. If an opponenet wants to escape, they must win a Quick Contest of ST or Escape against the binding's ST with a bonus equal to the critter's Magic. If they fail, they lose 1 FP but may try again. 
	
	The binding can alternatively be destroyed. Innate attacks hit automatically, but other attacks are at the usual -4. External attacks risk hitting the victim (B392). The binding itself has DR equal to 1/3 its level (round down). Eeach point of damage to the binding reduces its ST by 1, destroying it at ST 0.
	
	Certain attacks rely on environmental conditions to work, the most obvious case being an Earth Spirit requiring ground of some sort nearby that it can bind the target with.
	
	Critters usually have a number of levels in this ability equal to their Willpower.
	
	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{Statistics: Binding (Increased Range, LoS, +40\%; Environmental, -20\%; Magical, -10\%) [3.3 per level] for abilities without Environmental, it is [3.9 per level]}}
	
	
	\subsubsection{Concealment}\label{concealment}
	\begin{flushright}
		12/21/32/34/60/77/88/99 Points
	\end{flushright}
	
	The critter has the ability to mystically hide themselves alongside people and things nearby from perception. When active, anything \textit{of the critter's choice} within 2 yards of it becomes harder to view, taking penalties to all Vision based rolls (Including those using Ultravision, Infravision, and LADAR) and on any rolls that rely on Vision (Such as shooting rolls).
	
	There is no bonus to notice this concealment, as onlookers and cameras simply fail to process or record them - however, if anyone \textit{does} manage to break past the concealment and notice them, the power is immediately terminated and cannot be used again for 5 minutes\footnote{Timeframe taken from Maximum Duration -0\% limitation.}. The penalty also does not affect anyone that the critter conceals, allowing for perfect vision out of the area.
	
	The penalty is determined by the critter's Magic, which can also increase the radius that it can affect things, all detailed below.

	\subsubsection{Confusion}\label{confusion}
	\begin{flushright}
		42/56/70/84/98 Points
	\end{flushright}
	
	The critter has the ability to instill Confusion in a target in can see that can also see \textit{or} hear the critter (Choose only one). 
	
	Roll a Quick Contest between the Critter's Will+Magic vs the Target's Will, modified by normal Fright Check Modifiers (B360) as applicable. If the Critter wins, the target must immediately roll 3d on the Confusion Table (P85), adding their Margin of Failure to the result.
	
	If the target succeeds on their result, they are immune to the Critter's power for 1 hour, they also gain a +1 bonus to resist for every time the Critter has targeted them in the past 24 hours.
	
	Higher Magic critters are doubly more effective at this, imposing an additional -1 penalty every 3 Magic as detailed below.

	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{Statistics: Terror, Confusion (Active, +0\%; Increased Range LoS, +70\%; Sense Based, Vision, Reversed, -20\%; Magical, -10\%) [42] further levels add -1 to resist [14]
	}}
	
	\subsubsection{Elemental Attack}\label{elemental_attack}
	\begin{flushright}
		Variable Points
	\end{flushright}
	
	The critter can attack using an elemental force hurling at their foe. Roll to hit using Innate Attack (Projectile). The cost and effects vary depending on the element of choice, and are covered below. See Innate Attack (B60) for more detailed rules on the statistics of the attacks.
	
	This power is generally bought at a level equal to the critter's Magic, although the GM can make some exception for more or less powerful attacks.
	
	Not every elemental attack is created equal as well. Modifiers can be added or subtracted from these in order to better represent a specific use-case (e.g. Changing Ice to Burn damage with No Incendiary, -10\% to represent severe frostbite as opposed to a literal chunk of ice). While doing so, one should generally aim for a window of 3-7 points per level.

	\subsubsection{Engulf}\label{engulf}
	\begin{flushright}
		29/36/44 Points
	\end{flushright}
	
	The critter physically engulfs their target. To use the ability, the critter must first grapple their target, whose SM cannot exceed the critter's. On their next turn, and on each successive turn, roll a Quick Contest: 10+Magic vs. the victim's higher of ST or HT. If the critter wins, the target takes damage equal to the margin of victory; otherwise no damage. Usually, this is large-area injury (B400), unless the GM decides otherwise. As well, any Aura attack will be able to continually hit the victim.
	
	If the victim fails to break out between the time that he is grappled and when the critter makes Quick Contests, he's pinned (B370). This type of pin is completely hand free (usually providing the +3 for more free hands). However, a victim with abilities such as Innate Attack or Spines hit the critter automatically while engulfed.
	
	Higher levels of Magic make the attack \textit{even more potent.} At certain levels, add an armor divisor to the attack.

	\subsubsection{Fear}\label{fear}
	\begin{flushright}

	The critter has the ability to instill Fear in a target in can see that can also see \textit{or} hear the critter (Choose only one). 
	
	Roll a Quick Contest between the Critter's Will+Magic vs the Target's Will, modified by normal Fright Check Modifiers (B360) as applicable. If the Critter wins, the target must immediately roll 3d on the Fright Check Table (B360), adding their Margin of Failure to the result.
	
	If the target succeeds on their result, they are immune to the Critter's power for 1 hour, they also gain a +1 bonus to resist for every time the Critter has targeted them in the past 24 hours.

	\subsubsection{Guard}\label{guard}
	\begin{flushright}
		21/42/84 Points
	\end{flushright}
	
	The critter has the ability to prevent dangerous mishaps from occurring in its vicinity. Whenever an event that would be extremely dangerous - usually one that can cause a major wound, fright check, incapacitation in a dangerous place, or similar levels of threat - causes an Active Defense roll, resistance roll, HT, is a critical hit on an attack roll, or something similar, the ability can activate.
	
	For allies, the critter makes the target either roll two more times and take the best; while for opponents they must roll two more times and take the worst. This can only occur once every 24 hours.
	
	The ability can only activate for \textit{true emergencies.} Combat is not by default an emergency - especially for combat characters - it has to be dangerous beyond that. This is why it is usually a major wound, critical hit on an attack roll, or fright check.
	
	Higher Magic critters can Guard more times per day, as indicated in the table below:
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}

	\subsubsection{Movement}\label{movement}
	\begin{flushright}
		54 Points
	\end{flushright}
	
	This power allows a critter to greatly speed up or slow down certain objects. It only works on things that are already predisposed to motion, such as vehicles or creatures - no slowing down a door to block your opponents! 
	
	As well, the creature is only able to affect things within its own domain! For many mundane creatures, this means their home turf and likely the area surrounding it. For spirits, this tends to be associated with whatever their types is, with Air spirits affecting things that fly and Earth spirits affecting things touching the ground. In cases where these are not present, it doesn't necessairly prevent activating this power, it just makes the results \textit{at best} unpredictable.
	
	When attempting to speed something up, the creature rolls against their Will+Magic. The target gains Enhanced Move in half levels equal to the Margin of Succes (e.g. Margin of Success 3 gives Enhanced Move 1.5 \(\times\)3 maximum speed). Due to the uncoordinated use of this movement, all DX and Handling rolls are made with a -2 penalty and the user must focus completely on directing themselves; count this as an All-Out maneuver!
	
	When applying this to vehicles and creatures with Enhanced Move already, \textit{do not multiply their Enhanced Move.} Instead, add the Margin of Success to their Enhanced Move in half levels (e.g. A horse with Enhanced Move 1, giving \(\times\)2 max speed, increases their Enhanced Move to 2.5 with Margin of Success 3, giving \(\times\)6 max speed!)
	
	When attempting to slow something down, the creatures rolls a Quick Contest of Will+Magic vs the target's Will or HT for objects. If the critter wins, the target has their Basic Move reduced by 20\% per Margin of Victory, to a maximum of 0 move at MoV 5.
	
	The GM is entirely within their rights to call for a Control Roll whenever this ability is applied, especially when applied without any prior warning!
	
	It is all around harder to affect technological targets, providing a -6 to all rolls against them, whether to speed up or slow down.
	
	You can only have one type of these effects active at a time, no slowing down \textit{and} speeding up - although you can apply the same affect multiple times (Although to different targets of course).

	\subsubsection{Search}\label{search}
	\begin{flushright}
		29 Points +2 Points per Level
	\end{flushright}
	
	The critter has the magical ability to find objects or individuals that are familiar to them. To do so, the critter concentrates for 10 minutes and then makes a Per+Magic roll, modified by long-distance range modifiers to the target. On a success, they learn the direction of the thing that most matches their search, or whatever qualifies as the most significant source (e.g. if they are looking for their summoner, they might get their twin brother if not in range). As well, they will generally know how many familiar objects or individuals are present within range. 
	
	To narrow down the search, the critter must analyze their results. Roll against IQ+Magic; success lets them determine more precise details, with better margin of success providing better results. Some example results (In order of low to high difficulty) are: Search through all of the results they got for one specific one, discern between false positives, determine basic qualities about the target (such as emotional state, metatype, etc), determine more advanced qualities (such as health, vague knowledge of effects on them, etc).
	
	The critter can search for any item that they are normally familiar with, but if provided images or drawings can also search for ones that they are passingly familiar with, at a penalty. If the critter is able to get a good mental image from their summoner, alongside it being an object or creature that is easy to discern (e.g. A specific car with a license plate, as opposed to a car's model), make the roll at a -3. If instead, they can't get a mental image and instead rely on a drawn one \textit{or} if the object or creature is not easy to discern, make the roll at -6. If they have to rely on only a drawing \textit{and} the object or creature is hard to discern, make the roll at -10.
	
	Higher Magic creatures are doubly effective at tracking down objects, gaining a +1 bonus for every 2 Magic past 2. This is noted in the table below.
	
	This ability does not immediately let the spirit know exactly where the target is (Especially not enough to target them with attacks or effects), even though it provides direction. This is enough for them to generally track them down regardless, although they may need to detect multiple times to track down for longer searches.
	
	Individuals or objects that are behind mana barriers or otherwise protected from divination will be harder to detect. The effects of this will usually be covered in their sections. TODO: Come back later.
