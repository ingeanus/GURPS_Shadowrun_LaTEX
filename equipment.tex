\subsection{Fake SINs}\label{fake_SINs}

Fake SINs are the lifeline of any SINless runner. They allow you to shop at Stuffer Shack, walk around in public (At least in nice places), rent a house, buy gear legally, assuage the cops, get into places, and so on. Without a SIN, you are persona non grata, meaning that - while it might be considered unethical to most - you have little to no rights and can be fucked by any corpo with a chip on his shoulder.

Whenever it becomes important to determine whether a SIN holds up or not, the player must roll against the SIN's skill. Success means that the SIN holds, revealing no discrepancies. Critical Success means something positive happens; the GM is heavily suggested to tailor this to the situation, but a default result could be that the recent scan lends credibility to it, raising its rating by one level for its next check. 

A failure can result in the SIN being burned, with a failure by 1 or 2 usually eliciting confusion and/or further investigation by the scanner - which may serve as an opportunity to rectify the situation, or might serve as cause for increased suspicion!. Meanwhile, failure by more usually results in the SIN being automatically denied and flagged for deletion, which can have wide ranging consequences depending on the reason for the scan, but non-law enforcement individuals may be unlikely to recognize the reason behind the denial (Professional (Law Enforcement) +5, Law (Criminal) +3, or any other suitable skill at a bonus). A critical failure is extra bad; the SIN is automatically burned, and something other terrible thing happens, often being that the SIN registry alerts the authorities.

The level of scrutiny is also important when scanning a SIN. As an example, a normal tarry stop will usually provide no penalty or bonus, but distracted, quick, or non-critical scans may provide a +3 bonus, while something as uninvolved as name checks at the door or drone bulk scanning provides a +6 bonus. This is the only way for Rating 0 SINs to succeed, and skills above 16 should be considered to automatically succeed. 

On the other hand, involved scans can lower the odds, with a detention or arrest providing a -3 penalty, and something as extreme as a corporation buying data from other jurisdictions or collating long time periods can provide a -6 penalty. This is the only way for a Rating 6 SIN to fail, and skills below 4 should automatically fail.

Additionally, the SIN registries of nations constantly check for anomalies, dead individuals, and so on. While this process is one of the reasons it's possible to obtain fake SINs in the first place, it also will weed out fake identities over time. Each SIN has an Interval associated with it, representing how substantial, complex, confusing, or just difficult it is to audit the identity. After each interval of time passes, the player must roll vs the SIN's skill, with the results being the same as a noraml scan.

Fake SINs come in three categories, Burner, Default, and Lifestyle. Burner SINs are ones that do not last. They are meant to serve as a short term solution rather than a permanent identity. Often times, these types of SINs are provided by Johnsons for specific runs. Default SINs are the most common kind, with a lifespan measured in months, not weeks. These can survive long enough to be lived on, while not being expensive or risky enough to prevent use when committing crimes. Lastly, lifestyle SINs are meant to serve as full identities. If you're considering these, you should also consider the Alternative Identity advantage. Regardless, these are measured in years and are likely to last the whole game as long as they aren't put under serious scrutiny.

If you want to design a fake SIN for a specific circumstance, check out the \hyperref[bts_fake_SIN]{Behind the Screen section on Fake SINs,} which provides a number of possibilities for more finely tuned IDs.

\subsubsection{Alternative Rules}

Don't forget to check out the \hyperref[setting_equipment]{Equipment section of Setting} for a number of rulings from Pyramid articles that are used in this section!

\subsection{Armor and Clothing}

A runner's armor is his best defense against bullets, but it's also just as important to wear armor that won't get you shot at in the first place! The Sixth World is one where armored clothing is relatively common (for those who can afford it), but that doesn't mean that preparing to get shot isn't noteworthy to those in the know!

\subsubsection{Reflex Armor and Clothing}

Reflex armor makes use of STF (Sheer-Thickening Fluid) to reinforce normal improved kevlar. The fluid is made up of ceramic nanoparticles suspended in non-newtonian liquids designed to stiffen on impact, carefully built into the items so as to not limit their use as normal armor and clothing, while providing advanced protection. After treatment it allows for the kevlar to stiffen up when hit, greatly improving resistance while still maintaining flexibility and maneuverability.

However, those looking for alternative solutions may take to the Magnetic Liquid design. This design uses ferrous metallic particles suspended in a carrier fluid to stiffen into metallic plates when impacts are detected by sensors. It can protect the user against a wider variety of threats, but comes at the expense of both being more expensive alongside detectable by magnetic anomaly scanners (Or any sensor that can detect ferrous metals). Flexible suits built out of this material increase their cost by 33\%, but increase their secondary DR from 1/3 to 1/2 (e.g. 12/4* increases to 12/6*).

All armor has a modifier to its concealment equal to its DR/3+4 (HT66), which is further discussed in \hyperref[holdout]{the Holdout skill section.} As well, some armor pieces can apply bonuses to Holdout (B200), such as the Lined Coat, but these are usually assessed by the GM or noted in the description.

[1] - The full DR only applies against piercing and cutting damage. Use the second DR for all other damage types.

[2] - Incorporates an Undercover Holster (HT154).

[3] - Concealable under clothing or \textit{as} normal clothing.

[4] - Concealable as light clothing or can be very easily hidden under clothes.

[5] - DR to skull only applies to Rear, when hood is up.

[6] - Incorporates Thermo-Optic Chameleon Surface (UT98).

[7] - Provides a +4 bonus to Holdout for items hidden underneath.

[8] - Extremely concealable as any very light clothing or under anything.

\subsubsection{Trauma Plates}

Trauma plates are small Ceramic Nanocomposite plates that are meant to cover the upper torso from threats ranging from pistol rounds to heavy rifles. They can be carried in any plate carrier, load bearing gear, or certain armors by default as indicated (Full Body Armor, etc). Most plates are designed to cover the chest, but some for smaller vests only cover vital locations, while larger plates - largely only used by military or corporate soldiers - can cover the entire torso.

Trauma plates can also be made out of Titanium Nanocomposites, which prevent them from degrading quickly under fire at the expense of higher weight. Any plate can be made out of Titanium Nanocomposites which increases weight by 20\%, but removes the semi-ablative trait.

TODO: Check prices, one of these is wrong.

[1] - The DR is semi-ablative.

\subsection{Weapons}

Where not noted, all firearms follow TL 9 Ultratech conventions (Such as being Malf. 17, etc.). Some noteworthy things to remember are that all firearm weights are \textit{loaded weights}, and cost also include one \textit{loaded magazine} - or full reload if the firearm lacks a magazine.

TODO: Re-assess magazine cost to include bullets. Also include magazine cost into gun cost calcs.
TODO: Redo compensator weight, they actually remain the same at TL 9 instead of lowering.
TODO: Check folding stock weight, likely applied doubly and also had wrong weight.

\subsubsection{Light Machine Guns}

Light Machine Guns are rifled automatic firearms that are intended to provide a small group of individuals the rate of fire to support a variety of tactics while also denying the enemy similar ones. Often this is achieved through the use of Oportunity Fire (B390), Suppression Fire (B409), or sometimes Spraying Fire (B409), although these can - and often do - serve as high capacity replacements for normal automatic rifles.

Their weight and strength can sometimes exclude non goblinized individuals from taking them - even with TL 9 advancements in ammunitions and small-arm materials, but they can provide extreme amounts of support in a straight up engagement which should not be overlooked by those with the strength to wield them! Just don't go expecting them to magically deal more damage than a normal automatic rifle - pick up an HMG if you want that!

[1] - Laser Sight (UT149).

\subsubsection{Machine Guns}

Machine Guns are cover many categories of rifled automatic firearms that are intended to be used for direct sustained fire. Their purposes are often not to simply kill the enemy, but to instead provide enough fire to support other troops and to deter enemy strategies - often through the use of Oportunity Fire (B390), Suppression Fire (B409), or sometimes Spraying Fire (B409). Their major defining trait from Light Machine Guns (LMGs) is their platform - which is usually mounted on vehicles or more permanent mounts (although that is not necessarily case in the Sixth World).

These are almost exclusively mounted on vehicles and large drones, due to their size, but many goblinized individuals can make use of them as well - even if they are not designed for it! If the GM wants some KRIME or similar variants that are intended to be used by individuals, they should consider reducing weight, perhaps a bit of bulk and ST, increasing Rcl, and reducing capacity. Consider looking the Pyramid \#3/37's Blaser and Laser Design, which indicates how the configuration of a weapon affects its Acc, ST, and Bulk!

[2] - Includes integral D Cell.

\subsubsection{Pistols}

Pistols are small round firearms generally designed to be used in one hand. Due to their lack in almost every important metric, they are relegated to back-up and concealable weapons - used in extreme circumstances such as close range fights, smuggling through security, or so on. That being said, some pistols use very powerful rounds that can at least make up for stopping power if not rate of fire!

\subsubsection{Rifles}

Rifles are a diverse set of long arms that make use of rifled barrels to increase accuracy. They fill an extremely wide variety of roles, but are generally classified into Shadowrun's Categories of Rifles/Assault Rifles, Sniper Rifles, and Sporting Rifles.

There's no one role that Rifles excel at, bringing high damage, Accuracy, and Range at the cost of higher Weight, Bulk, and often Rcl. This pushes them towards medium range engagements where targets cannot close the distance quickly alongside targets with good armour and protection. Sniper Rifles in particular are specially crafted to excel at extreme ranges - often over 300 meters, but easily extending up to over a mile - although they can be difficult to properly use in urban environments. An important consideration for any Shadowrunner is how difficult Rifles are to properly conceal and explain away; most are LC 2 or below, which can mean serious trouble if spotted, alongside averaging -4/-5 in Holdout penalties compared to -2/-3 for SMGs and pistols.

\subsubsection{Shotguns}

Shotguns are smoothbore firearms that usually fire multiple projectiles in the form of shotshell, flechette, and so on. There are plenty of options for ammunition in High Tech 162+ and Ultratech 152+ to consider, such as Rifled Slugs and Flechette. 

They excel against unarmored targets, however Multi-Shot projectiles often fall flat against any amount of armour, making them unsuitable against anything better than Armor Clothing - although don't pass up on Random Hit Locations, because it is very easy to incapacitate an opponent when hitting 6 random spots, even if most of their body is protected! While they can use Rifled Slugs to overcome this, they tend to not be as effective as a normal Rifle would be.

It is heavily recommended to use the shotguns created here, due to Ultratech's shotguns being generally \textit{worse} than High Tech's.

\subsubsection{Submachine Guns}

Submachine Guns fill a special niche somewhere inbetween Long-arms such as Rifles (Especially Assault Rifles) and Pistols, providing high rates of fire for pistol caliber rounds without being too much larger than a standard pistol. 

They excel in close quarters where the need to stay on the move and get up close are helped with their relatively low bulk and common use of folding stocks. They can struggle against flexible armour without some form of armour piercing - and will almost always be stopped by trauma plates!

\subsection{Ammunition}

Ammunition in Shadowrun is overwhelmingly made of Caseless ammunition and Combustible Cased Telescopic ammunition, allowing for decreased weights and increased magazine sizes. This section contains ammunition for all the weapon provided in this book, however the GM should feel free to add additional types as necessary, which can be accomplished by halving the weight from the modern contemporaries in GURPS High Tech. \textit{Alternatively,} for GMs that wish to maintain the universal ammunition classes from Shadowrun, there are optional generic versions included as well. \newline

\subsubsection{Warheads and Ammo Types}

Most Warheads and Ammo can simply be found in High Tech 162+ and Ultratech 152+. However, this section details how to either update some rounds to TL9, the custom ammunition here, and/or the Shadowrun setting.

\subsection{Firearm Accessories}
The UT148 Firearm Accessories are \textit{not} included by default on Shadowrun's guns. Usually, none of the equipment is included by default, however GMs may find that diagnostic computers (UT151) should be included by default. If using pre-made equipment from UltraTech (\textit{Not Transhuman Space}), lower cost by 250\$.

Players should also look into the \hyperref[3/55]{Pyramid \#3/55 section}, which covers many ideas, updates, and improvements to basic Ultratech equipment and accessories.

\subsubsection*{Smartgun}
1,900¥, 0.12 lb

Smartguns are a technological wonder for the modern gunfighter. A composite of multiple sensors and software suites, including cameras, laser rangefinders, material sensors, and more - they are able to maintain many of the the difficult information in a gunfight alongside calculating optimal firing solutions for the user.

Smartguns themselves are made up of a Dedicated Tiny Computer (25¥, 0.01lb, UT22) running a HUD Link (250¥, UT149, PY:55 8), Targeting Software C3 (500¥, UT149), and Target Tracking C3 (1000¥, UT149), a Diagnostic Computer (25¥, 0.01 lb, UT151), and multi-spectral laser rangefinder (100¥, 0.1 lb TS 27) all in one tiny package. These provide a slew of bonuses and options for a gunfighter. 

The Dedicated Tiny Computer - equipped with a cable jack (UT 42), micro radio communicator (UT 44), and mini-camera (UT 51\footnote{While referenced in the Datapad entry, this doesn't technically exist. Either way it's simply a negligible weight, cost, and powered camera.}) is hardwired to run its programs, which provide a total of +2 bonus to all Guns and Gunner skill to use the firearm alongside the ability to track up to 100 targets or objects of note. Additionally, the HUD's improvements to situational awareness provide +1 to skill rolls when reacting to information quickly is important (UT 24) alongside removing up to -3 in darkness penalties with Sighted or Aimed Shooting (TS 13-14) with it due to its illuminated markers (PY:55 8) - for which it \textit{always is} when using a HUD link, alongside other bonuses (PY:55 8). PY:55 8 also covers how to use this to shoot around corners.

The firearm's \hyperref[diagnostic_computer]{Diagnostic Computer (25¥, 0.01 lb)} provides a number of useful functions when combined with the HUD Link as described below.

Lastly, the multispectral laser rangefinder can provide the Rangefinder Bonus (TS 27) as a Free Action when combined with a HUD Link and Targeting Software, giving a +3 bonus to Acc.

When combined with Smartgun Cyberware, this can instead run Complexity 4 Targeting Software, giving an additional +1 to Guns and Gunner skill. Increased costs are incorporated into the Cyberware itself, so simply buy them both together. While it is easily possible for a gunfighter to buy a Fast Tiny Computer and load such software into his normal gun without getting cyberware, it's in the spirit of the setting for the GM to disallow such things. 

\subsubsection*{Compensator}
125¥, 0.1/0.25/0.35 lb

Compensator rules are covered in Tactical Shooting p76.

\subsubsection{Laser Sight}\label{laser_sight}
75¥, 0.05 lb

A Muli-spectral Laser Sight UT (149) serves as the lower-tech solution for any firearm. It provides +1 to skill when used out to the 1/2D if you can see it, but also provides a +1 to dodge it if \textit{your opponent} can see it! For most lasers and ranges their beam-width gives a SM of -13 to -10 alongside bonuses for brightness and contrasting (up to the GM, a good heuristic is a bonuse equal to the darkness penalty +1, with a bonus similar to camouflage bonuses and penalties (HT 76)).

\subsubsection{Folding Stock}
100¥, 0.5 lb.

Adding folding stocks to firearms is covered under High Tech 160.

\subsubsection*{Diagnostic Computer}\label{diagnostic_computer}
25¥, 0.01 lb.\footnote{Priced and weighted as a Dedicated Tiny Computer with free basic software.}

A common addition to many firearms, especially when included in smartgun packages, the Diagnostic Computer both helps to maintain the firearm itself while also providing an array of useful gunfighting information (PY55:7). 

In addition to its +1 bonus to all rolls to diagnose and repair damage and malfunctions (including Immediate action rolls), it also is able to alert the user to low/empty magazines - or display the amount on a HUD link (TS 20). Additionally, the types of ammunition can be easily tracked, which can make mixing ammunition (TS 31) slightly less stupid. In hazardous environments that would readily affect the malfunction of the gun, the computer can alert the user of the issues; this is not a replacement for genuine hazardous environment warning equipment though, as it only indirectly warns users of such things (e.g. receiving a warning for lubricant malfunctions due to the pressure in a room suddenly dropping). Do note that displays, HUD Links, and terminals (UT 23-24, 149, PY:55 8)are not included by default, requiring a cable to retrieve information.

\subsubsection{Suppressor}
100-800¥, 0.5/1/2 lb

Covered under High Tech p158-159, Tactical Shooting p70-71 and PY:55 p11, suppressors are heavily enhanced for TL 9. They provide Hearing penalties from -1 to -8 - with a standard of -6 (Which is present on all firearms in the tables) - and cost 100¥ per -1 of Hearing penalties. Weights above are for pistols, rifles (and similar sized weapons), and for oversized guns respectively.

\subsubsection{Firearm Noise}

Pyramid \#3/55 - Military Sci-Fi, Tactical Shooting: Tomorrow notes how Electronic Firing lowers the volume for firearms and changes the table found on High Tech 158, which is noted in this table:


\subsubsection{Hearing Distance Table}

\subsection{Drones}\label{drones}

Drones are semi-autonomous electrical robots that can provide a wide variety of utility, ranging from combat, to scouting, to repair work, and more.

\subsubsection{Drone Meta-Trait}
\begin{flushright}
	22 Points
\end{flushright}

All drones have a number of traits that are in common with on another. This Meta-Trait combines them all in order to keep the statblocks reasonably concise to read. The drone meta-trait deals purely with the body of the drone, and as such only include physical traits and attributes - anything that a pilot program specifies overrides this template!

Notably, drone bodies indicate their DX as a bonus instead of a flat trait. This is because digital minds / riggers use their own DX, modified by the drone body's (e.g. a rigger with DX 12 jumping into a Doberman acts as if he had DX 14).

All drones have \hyperref[firewall]{Firewalls} that come with their models. For drones SM-5 and smaller, this is usually a Complexity 3 Inferior Firewall; for up to SM+1, this is usually a Complexity 4 Standard Firewall; for up to SM+4, this is usually a Complexity 5 Standard Firewall; higher SM drones are usually the same, however it is possible for drones SM+8 to be Complexity 6, for drones up to SM+12 to be Complexity 7, and for drones up to SM+16 to be Complexity 8, although once you're past 4 it's more of a server than a drone. Some drones will instead opt for Superior Firewalls instead of higher Complexities.

It's also important to note some advantages and disadvantages that one might mistake drones for having. Many drones will likely make use of singular cameras, which might imply the One Eye [-15] disadvantage. However, many cameras can make use of varied detection and processing tactics that practically remove any loss of depth perception. Many Injury Tolerances may seem immediately likely, such as No Vitals or No Brain. However, these are just different object in a drone, notably the brain usually being the CPU.

\textbf{Advantages:} 
Absolute Direction (Requires Signal, -20\%; Mundane Countermeasures, -10\%) [4]; Doesn't Sleep [20]; High Pain Threshold [10]; Injury Tolerance (No Blood, No Neck, Unliving) [30]; Injury Tolerance (Independant Body Parts) (Reattachment Only, -50\%; Nuisance Effect, Reattachment requires maintenance, -5\%) [16]; Resistant (Immunity, Metabolic Hazards) [30]; Telecommunication, Radio (Secure, +20\%; Sensie, +80\%; Mundane Countermeasures, -10\%; Reduced Range, x1/10, -30\%) [16]

\textbf{Disadvantages:} 
Electrical [-20]; Maintenance (1 Person, Monthly) [-2]; No Sense Smell/Taste [-5]; Reprogrammable [-10]; Restricted Diet, Electricity (Very Common) [-10]; Short Lifespan 1 [-10]; Social Stigma (Valuable Property) [-10]; Unhealing (Total) [-30]; Unnatural Features (Detectable by scanners) [-5]

\textbf{Perks:}
Accessory, Computer [0\footnote{The cost for Accessory, Computer will be included on the drone sheets themselves.}]

\textbf{Quirks:}
Affected by Magnetism [-1]; Cannot Float [-1]

\textbf{Traits:}
Complexity Limited IQ [0]; Machine [0]; Sexless [0]

\subsubsection{Pilot Program Meta-Trait}
\begin{flushright}
	-178/-126/-74/-22/30/92 Points
\end{flushright}

The pilot program is the brain of a drone. While they're not especially bright, they have enough intelligence to respond to general commands given by their owner alongside enough problem solving to compete with most animals well enough. 

It's important to note that drone IQ is not equivalent to animal (or low human) IQ though. Drones are narrow intelligences, which means that while they aren't as great at general tasks, they excel rather well at what they're designed to do. This means they tend to have high skills, with low attributes; your smart car is really good at the complex task of driving your around town, following traffic laws, responding to emergencies, and more - but it does not really \textit{understand} these concepts (navigation, object recognition, laws, and ethics), it is just pre-programmed with ways to react to them (with the line blurring for Rating 6 programs), and is even less competent at tasks outside its prior programming like map-making.

As well, many pilot programs are designed to meld specifically with the equipment that they are entrusted with. In much the same way that you might take note of the many quirks in your vehicle or body, the pilot program will adjust its capabilities to match the minor variations in each drone. While this does allow for the stellar capabilities of drones, it does also tend to make them only useful for a specific piece of hardware after a short period of training. It's even heard of that pilot programs will do this with other equipment as well, such as firearms or sensors that it uses regularly.

Each pilot program comes with a specific Rating. This indicates how complex and sophisticated their programming is, giving them higher intelligence, coordination, processing, and defense. For \textit{general problem solving}, the GM should consider comparing the IQ of the program to an animal of equal or - more often - less IQ, in order to guesstimate their capabilities.

The original Shadowrun did not place any restriction on Pilot Rating for Drones (Barring some indirect ones..), however these programs should be treated as having a Complexity equal to their Rating/2 (rounded up). This will likely only ever greatly impact extremely small drones.

\textbf{Attributes:} 
IQ equal to Rating [-135 to -60]. DX, Per, and Will equal to Rating+6 [-296 to 74]

\textbf{Advantages:} 
Absolute Timing [2]; Digital Mind [5]; Doesn't Sleep [20]; Indomitable [15]; Intuitive Mathematician [5]; Photographic Memory [10]

\textbf{Disadvantages:} 
Hidebound [-5]; Incurious (SC 6) [-10]; Low Empathy [-20]; No Sense of Humor [-10]

\textbf{Skills:}\footnote{These cover only the core skills for all Pilot Programs. Many other drones have specific skills, which are covered in either the autosofts or drone sections.}
Computer Operation (E) IQ+4 [12]; Electronics Operation (Sensors) (A) IQ+3 [12]; Expert Skill (Computer Security) (H) IQ+2 [12]; Driving, Piloting, or Running (\textit{Specific drone model}) (A) HT/DX+2 [8]; Tactics (H) IQ+2 [12]

\textbf{Perks and Quirks:}
The GM should feel free to add some mental Perks and Quirks as pilot programs adjust to their models!

\textbf{Traits:}
Complexity Limited IQ [0]

\subsubsection{Autosofts}

Anyone can purchase an autosoft for a skill at a rate of 2,000¥ per CP. Common ones include Guns, Gunner, Observation, and Stealth. Autosofts have a complexity based on their CP, starting at Complexity 2 for 1 CP, and increasing by +1 Complexity per doubling of CP. Riggers may run Autosofts for drones in their network, as covered in the \hyperref[rigger_rules]{Rigging Section.}

	\subsection{Drone Modifications}
	
	The best part of being a rigger is modifying your precious metal children to your heart's content. Luckily, GURPs makes this even easier than Shadowrun, following normal character creation process for the drone. 
	
	It is noteworthy however, that unless you are buying a drone as a body (such as for an AI), many items can be simply included as an Accessory by paying for their normal cost isntead of taking a corresponding advantage (e.g. Accessory, Small Tactical Radar [1] and 5,000¥ instead of Scanning Sense). The GM should assign costs to anything not available to equipment, and a good heuristic is: $points^{2}$, rounded up. (I fully intend to come back and add many of the Rigger 5 modifications pre-built here later.)
	
	\subsection{Vehicles}
	
	TODO: Once I create my GURPS Vehicle applet, until then it will have to wait!
	
	\subsection{Foci and Reagents}
	
	Foci are astral constructs that are tied to physical housing, allowing those who bind to them to use the stored mana for highly specialized tasks. Much like other astral constructs, foci have Force values, which measure how powerful they are. As well, they have a wide variety of highly specialized benefits, which must be selected and constructed for the user.
	
	Foci, like any other awakened aspect, are highly personal. It's unlikely that you'll find some chummer selling these in a store, even a magical-focused one, unless you're a straight Hermetic or Shaman tradition. They only work for the traditions that they were made for, and are hard to craft for those who aren't intimately familiar with that tradition in the first place (Imagine a Christian Theurgist making a focus for a Black Mage!). Even beyond that, many foci are personalized to the individual who made them!
	
	As such, most foci are custom-made or custom-ordered, which requires recipes or enchanters respectively - both of which can be hard to acquire!
	
	Because of how involved all aspects of Magic are, player won't be able to simply purchase a focus, plug it in, and walk away with the bonuses. Focuses are advantages with Gadget Limitations, however, depending on what they apply to, it can require applying those Gadget Limitations to multiple improvements, as detailed in each section. As well, the player must remember that whenever they upgrade or add advantages, spells, or powers that are affected by their foci, the costs change and \textit{must} be recalculated!
	
	All Foci have one of the listed modifiers. These assume that the foci is made out of or reinforced by strong metallic, composite, or other durable material. Many shamanic traditions might make them out of wood, hair, or materials with DR 2 or less, in which case increase the value of the limitations by -5\%.
	
	\textbf{Charm Focus:} This is a small (Around 3") focus, made out of materials like wood, straw, leather, etc.
	
	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{Charm Focus, -70\%: Breakable, DR 2, -20\%; SM -8, -5\%; Can Be Stolen, Quick Contest DX, Does not work for Thief, -15\%; Nuisance Effect, Dual-Natured, -5\%; Unique, -25\%)}}
	
	\textbf{Ring Focus:} This is a tiny ring, made out of a durable metal or composite.
	
	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{Ring Focus, -60\%: Breakable, DR 5, -15\%; SM -10, -0\%; Can Be Stolen, Quick Contest DX, Does not work for Thief, -15\%; Nuisance Effect, Dual-Natured, -5\%; Unique, -25\%)}}
	
	\textbf{Wand Focus:} This is a middling sized wand, usually in the ballpark of 16" long. It's generally considered to be made out of metal, metal wood, or reinforced wood, giving it enough durability to survive glancing blows.
	
	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{Wand Focus, -75\%: Breakable, DR 5, -15\%; SM -4, -15\%; Can Be Stolen, Quick Contest ST, Does not work for Thief, -15\%; Nuisance Effect, Dual-Natured, -5\%; Unique, -25\%)}}
	
	\textbf{Staff Focus:} This is a sizeable staff, around the size of a good walking stick (55"). It's generally considered to be made out of metal, metal wood, or reinforced wood, giving it enough durability to survive glancing blows.
	
	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{Staff Focus, -80\%: Breakable, DR 5, -15\%; SM -1, -20\%; Can Be Stolen, Quick Contest ST, Does not work for Thief, -15\%; Nuisance Effect, Dual-Natured, -5\%; Unique, -25\%)}}
	
	\textbf{Tattoo Focus:} A tattoo on the awakened's body, usually around 3"x3" in size. Larger or smaller tattoos are entirely possible (Such as a Yakuza's entire sleeve!), in which case change the SM limitation accordingly.
	
	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{Tattoo Focus, -60\%: Breakable, DR 0, -20\%; SM -6, -10\%; Nuisance Effect, Dual-Natured, -5\%; Unique, -25\%)}}
	
	\textbf{One-Handed Weapon Focus:} This is a weapon around the size of a longsword, ace, or mace. It is assumed to be made of mixed wood/composites and metals, usually giving DR 4, but sometimes allowing for DR 5. Weapons made entirely out of metal tend to be DR 6 (or sometimes a bit more), in which case replace DR 4-5, with DR 6-15, -10\%.
	
	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{One-Handed Weapon Focus, -80\%: Breakable, DR 4-5, -15\%; SM -2, -20\%; Can Be Stolen, Quick Contest ST, Does not work for Thief, -15\%; Nuisance Effect, Dual-Natured, -5\%; Unique, -25\%)}}
	
	\textbf{Two-Handed Weapon Focus:} This is a weapon around the size of a greatsword or polearm. It is assumed to be made of mixed wood/composites and metals, usually giving DR 4, but sometimes allowing for DR 5. Weapons made entirely out of metal tend to be DR 6 (or sometimes a bit more), in which case replace DR 4-5, with DR 6-15, -10\%.
	
	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{Two-Handed Weapon Focus, -85\%: Breakable, DR 4-5, -15\%; SM +0, -25\%; Can Be Stolen, Quick Contest ST, Does not work for Thief, -15\%; Nuisance Effect, Dual-Natured, -5\%; Unique, -25\%)}}
	
	\subsubsection{Power Focus} Power Foci increase an awakened's \textit{entire Magic attribute!} They are very powerful, and also accordingly expensive.
	
	Power Foci must apply their Foci Limitation to the point difference for \textit{every single trait that increases from Magic.} This usually includes, the Magic Advanatage, all spells, summoning, binding, all critter powers, and sometimes other foci!
	
	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{Example: Yukon is having custom-made a Force 1 Power Focus. He has Magic 4 [30] naturally, alongside the Fireball [46] spell, which he spent [13] points on. The increase to Magic 5 is [7.5] points, and the Magic 5 Fireball is [55] points. This means the increase costs 7.5 + (55 - 46)/5 [9.3] points. Yukon applies the Charm Focus, -70\% to this, bringing the total to [2.79], rounded up to [3] points.}}
	
	\subsubsection{Spellcasting Focus} Spellcasting Foci increase an awakened's capabilities within \textit{one category} of spells.
	
	Spellcasting Foci must apply their Foci Limitation to the point difference for \textit{every single spell in the Foci's category, alongside a Magic limited to One Category.}
	
	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{Example: Yukon is having custom-made a Force 1 Power Focus. He has Magic 4 [30] naturally, alongside the Fireball [46] spell, which he spent [13] points on. The increase to Magic 5 is Magic (Combat Spells Only, -80\%) [1.5] points, and the Magic 5 Fireball is [55] points. This means the increase costs 1.5 + (55 - 46)/5 [3.3] points. Yukon applies the Charm Focus, -70\% to this, bringing the total to [0.99], rounded up to [1] points.}}
	
	\subsubsection{Reagents}
	
	Most Reagents costs are noted in the ability's description, indicating the value of reagents that must be spent. These can be in singular or multiple amounts, as long as the value is met. Reagents can also be used to reduce drain, in which case around 1,600¥ worth of reagents reduces one FP drain, while 1,000¥ reduces one HP drain\footnote{Priced according to HP or FP (Energy Reserve, -10\%) [1.8 or 2.7]/5*3,000¥ for one use.}. TODO: Decide whether the just average the two instead of having two styles.
	
	You can spend time to purify and improve collected reagents, using alchemical processes and equipment. If you have a settled lifestyle, usually the equipment for this can be covered in the settled income (With higher Status have better toolkits, workstations, etc). In such a case, you simply earn reagents of value according to the Jobs rule (B516), with Alchemy as your job skill; higher Status characters are able to afford better equipment and therefore distill more or higher quality reagents. 
	
	For wanderer characters.. well why would you have an entire lab's worth of alchemical equipment? If that is the case, you should buy toolkits for the Alchemy skill, and earn reagents of value equal to a job your Status. Remeber that many wanderer characters are low Status, or at least cannot gain high Status, meaning that they are not likely to be able to create much.
	
	You may also gather raw reagents yourself, from areas of magic potency related to your tradition. This can earn you reagents valued up to a job's wages of your Status, although it often will be equivalent Status -1 to 0 without access to a well hidden or maintained source.
