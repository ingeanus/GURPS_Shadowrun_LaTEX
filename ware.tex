	\subsection{'Ware \& Essence Rules}
	
	When replacing one's flesh with chrome and bioware, you lose a part of yourself - bit by bit. A metahuman has something intangible, that some Awakened call a soul, some call humanity, but is referred to as Essence. The more technology that is placed into a body, the less Essence it can retain. 
	
	This has a number of competing hypothesis (and traditions) for explanation, such as the soul being damaged, or the astral self not being able to connect to the complex technology as well as it does with a biological person. Regardless, those that lose their Essence tend to devolve into all manners of anti-social behaviour. Basically everything the APA could throw at you is on the table.
	
	When installing 'Ware, there are a variety of grades to choose from, ranging - from worst to best - Used up to Deltaware. Better grades generally providing cleaner installations that affect a customer's Essence less negatively, at the cost of a larger price tag. 
	
	Higher grades are also much more difficult to acquire, due to regulations restricting their use, secrecy regarding their technology and dissemination, and strong connections required to even access them. Betaware reduces LC by 1, while Deltaware reduces LC by 2.
	
	As to whether a piece is invasive or not is left to the GM, but general guidelines are to read their descriptions here or in Shadowrun's books and that it is usually the case for the expensive, shiny, pieces such as Wired Reflexes or Control Rigs.
	
	When the 'Ware is purchased, consult the 'Ware Modifier table for the grade, type, and invasiveness of the piece. Sum up all of the relevant modifiers. This number is used to determine what proportion of the piece's cost must be spent on Character Points versus with Nuyen. It does not include operating costs, if the GM chooses to use those.

	After adding up all of the relevant modifiers, one can determine the proportion of points to Nuyen.

	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Example: Rigger Joe takes a Control Rig R1, which is 44 Points. It’s definitely an “Invasive Ware” which gives -1, so the GM says he pays 9 of the 44 as Nuyen, costing 27,000¥ and uses 35 unspent CP for the remainder. }}
	
	Additionally, after determining how many unspent points are going to be used 1/3 - 1/2 of those points must be taken as Disadvantages (For which the user can offset the CP cost of the 'Ware with). 
	
	Most often, these should be taken from Mental disadvantages having to deal with social and mental stability in some fashion, but you can also lose skills or advantages as is reasonable.
	
	Additionally, if the user has any Magic related Advantages, \textit{at least half} if not more of the disadvantages or points lost must be taken from the Magic Advantages or skills.
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Example: The GM decides that Joe must take 1/2 the cost in disadvantages. Now, Joe needs to take around 18 points in disadvantages. Firstly, he's become more of bumbling oaf since them, taking Oblivious [-5] and Noisy 2 [-4] for -9 points. He also decides that his newfound capabilities have made him reckless, taking On the Edge (SC 15, x1/2) [-8]. The GM decides that -17 points is good.}}
	
	
	
	\begin{wrapfigure}[12]{l}{85pt}
		
	\end{wrapfigure}
	
	Certain 'ware has point costs of very small points or even negative points, most often cyber-replacement parts due to their overall downsides. 
	
	For small costs, first look into options such as lowering Self-Control numbers, lowering social skills, or taking quirks. However, if those are not available, it is fine to change the proportions of CP and nuyen to either ignore CP costs as negligible.
	
	For negative point pieces, players should generally be encouraged to simply by enough enhancements to make it positive. However, it is important to point out that the Cyberware Meta-Trait will often accompany such cases, which must also be accounted for when determining the cost of the implant and will often cost enough to bring the total positive.
	
	If neither of these solutions are desireable for these two cases, the GM can lower the operation costs by 3,000¥ per character point, bringing the total higher overall. In the case of negative point 'ware, this can be used to assess essence disadvantages.
	
	Some players or GMs might be concerned about the idea that a character in the setting being able to afford relatively common cyberware such as a Datajack, given that they cost thousands of dollars. Don't forget that most people are making +50\% of TL8 wages first of all, but also do not forget that corporations have a vested incentive to make wageslaves indebted to them through expensive surgeries for mandatory job equipment (such as a Datajack)! If this is not convincing enough, the GM can always allow point debts to reduce costs, as detailed below.
	
	\subsubsection{Point Debts}
	
	To many players and GMs, it won't make sense that a character has to wait for Character Points in order to acquire 'ware they have cash for right now. In such a case, a GM can consider the option of Point Debts.
	
	Point Debts are where a player takes negative points equal to the CP cost of the 'Ware (after all necessary calculations), allowing them to take the piece of 'Ware without having the necessary points. 
	
	These negative points must be taken in disadvantages that represent certain short-term negatives associated with the 'ware. Usually, this is instances such as immune-rejection or blockers (Take Susceptibility to Disease, Wounded, etc), shoddy design or implantation that must be rectified (Lowered attributes, disadvantages associated with the cyberware's effects, etc), contracts that require follow-up visits (Maintenance), and so on. For players inventing their own 'ware, this can represent them making improvements to the equipment as time goes on, reducing side-effects and bugs. As the player acquires more points, these should be spent on removing these disadvantages, representing these short-term effects dissapearing with proper care, maintenance, or rectification.
	
	\subsubsection{Alternative Essence-Loss Disadvantages}
	
	While many normal disadvantages serve perfect for essence loss, there are a number of special cases that should be considered as options when adding essence loss:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep 0pt
		\item Vulnerability x2/x3/x4, Essence Loss Abilities (Rare) [-10/-15/-20] \newline
		Characters with very low essence are at high risk from abilities that drain essence, such as the \hyperref[essence_drain]{Essence Drain critter power.} Whenever they take damage from those sources, multiply it by the chosen amount. The GM Should consider enforcing this at certain milestones of essence loss, such as an additional level every -30 points.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Making Cyberware}
	
	Unlike our fleshy meat-bodies, cyberware has a wide variety of noteworthy advantages and disadvantages. These are represented by three important things: The Cyberware Meta-Trait, the Cyberware Power Modifiers, and the Cyberware Counter Advantages.
	
	\subsubsection{Cyberware Meta-Trait}\label{cyberware-meta-trait}
	
	Any part of a character's body that can be damage, need to take the Cyberware Meta-Trait. This is a collection of advantages that, in total, represent the features of chrome flesh.
	
	When taking the Meta-Trait, it must be limited to whatever parts of the body that are cybered up. GMS are advised to not use the \textit{Partial} modifier for damage resistance, due to its incapability to allow multiple differing hit locations; \textcolor{Blue}{\href{http://forums.sjgames.com/showpost.php?p=623207&postcount=1}{Kromm's Post on Partial DR for Hit Location}} is better, but also troublesome for having a very high minimum and low maximum that distort the values.
	
	Instead, I devised rules to allow the \textit{Partial} limitation to apply for multiple hit locations, which you can find in the \hyperref[partial]{Behind the Scenes section here.} While a table is provided below for ease of use, if you need to calculate some unique locations, check out that section for instructions on how to do so. Keep in mind that these are numerically generated, and while some are adjusted to keep things fair, the differences between two options might be so small that there's little difference (e.g. Both Hands versus Hands \& Feet); the GM should decide whether to allow certain limitations at each value in order to prevent players from just throwing on anything and everything they can. \textcolor{Blue}{\href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9vo3aBTs2W7UExsUEZGNjdJejg/view?resourcekey=0-pGjkVxQLp-67-iHB73z1dQ}{Check out Bruno's Grand Unified Hit Locations.}}
	
	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{Example: John is making a punk Character with two Cyberarms and Torso. He takes the Cyberware Meta-Trait with the \textit{Torso \& Two Limbs, -5\%} limitation applied to it. If he wanted something more complex, such as a cybered up Jaw, Torso, Forearms, and Hands, he would have to calculate the value for that himself as instructed in the Behind the Scenes section.}}

	\subsubsection*{Cyberware Meta-Trait}
	\begin{flushright}
		26 Points base\footnote{The cost will change drastically depending on the limitation. Do not just apply the limitation to the base cost. Do some math.}
	\end{flushright}
	\subparagraph{Advantages:}
	High Pain Threshold [10], Injury Tolerance (Unliving) [20], Injury Tolerance (Independant Body Parts) (Reattachment Only, -50\%; Nuisance Effect, Reattachement requires maintenance, -5\%)[16], Injury Tolerance (No Blood) [5], Resistant (Immunity, Metabolic Hazards) [30]
	\subparagraph{Disadvantages:}
	Reprogrammable [-10], Social Stigma (Valuable Property) [-10], Unhealing (Total) [-30], Unnatural Features (Detectable) [-5]
	
	\subsubsection{Cyberware Power Modifier}
	
	When creating advantages to represent Cybernetics, there are a number of effects that can interact with your Cyberware specifically, whether it be shutting it down, hacking it, or it just requiring maintenance. The collection of these limitations form the power modifier for Cyberware, although they are not likely to apply to every piece of cyberware.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown (Electrical), -20\%
		\item Maintenance (1 Person, Weekly or Monthly), -5\% or -3\% \footnote{Most 'ware in Shadowrun does not seem to require consistent maintenance, so this may only rarely apply.}
		\item Nuisance Effect (Detectable by Scanners), -5\%
		\item Mundane Countermeasures, -10\%\footnote{Only specific advantages will include mundane countermeasures. It only applies when normally accessible countermeasures can affect the power (such as a fore extinguisher putting out a burn innate attack). This often applies for advantages that can be jammed, spoofed, hacked or dos-ed, stopped by mundane equipment, or controlled.}
	\end{itemize}
	
	When you create or choose a cybernetic advantage, sum all of the respective modifiers and apply it to the advantage as necessary.
	
	For the purposes of this book I will use the following two power modifiers:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Technological, -35\%: (Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, Electrical,  -20\%; Mundane Countermeasures, -10\%; Nuisance Effect, Detectable by scanners, -5\%)
		\item Electrical, -25\%: (Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, Electrical, -20\%; Nuisance Effect, Detectable by scanners, -5\%)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Cyberware Counter Advantage}
	
	Certain pieces of Cyberware have notable negatives if they are shutdown, past the usual of shorting out, freaking out, or shutting down. The prime example of this is a Cyberarm, which, when shut down, would leave you with the One Arm disadvantage. 
	
	Advantages that are replaced with Disadvantages when the cyberware is disabled need to create a Counter Advantage Meta-Trait in order to represent this.
	
	This is done by creating a Meta-Trait that includes the Disadvantage and a mirror Advantage that negates it. The mirror Advantage must take any amount of Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown and Mundane Countermeasures limitations to represent the effects that make it stop working; often these are Electrical and Maintenance.
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Example: Jet Stream Sam is getting his first Cyberarm. He's already got his Meta-Trait and Power Modifier, now he needs his Counter Advantage. When his Cyberarm is shutdown, he will have the One Arm [-20] disadvantage. He builds the Counter Advantage to be: One Arm [-20] and NOT One Arm (Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, -20\%) [16] for a total Meta-Trait of [-4].}}
	
	\subsubsection{80+ Points of Cyberware and Power Modifiers}
	
	One issue that GM will have to keep an eye out is the inclusion of \textit{Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, Electrical} in the Cyberware Power Modifier! This is because, Temporary Disadvantages (B115) can only give back up to 80\% of the points for that disadvantage! As a simple example, if you take \textit{Altered Time Rate 1} [100] and slap \textit{Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, Electrical, -20\%} on it, it maxes out at -16\%.
	
	However, there is a second, more insidious case of this. If you were to take \textit{DX +2} [50], \textit{IQ +2} [30], and \textit{HT +2} [30] and put \textit{Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, Electrical, -20\%} on all of them, the total refund of \textbf{\textit{all}} Temporary Disadvantages cannot exceed 80\%. This means that instead of costing (50+30+30)$\times$80\% = [88], it instead costs (50$\times$80\%) + (30$\times$80\%) + (30$\times$100\%) = 94 points (A decreased of 110-16$\rightarrow$94).
	
	If a character takes more than 80 base points in advantages that will have the Cybernetic Power Modifiers applied to them, the GM should restrict that to a maximum of 16 points returned. To make things simple (Especially if using the pre-built 'ware found in this book), they can add a +20\% enhancement to all cyberware advantages (i.e. remove the Temporary Disadvantage limitation) and simply add -16 points to the character (Which does not count against their disadvantage limit). Alternatively, they can simply add the \textit{Electrical} [-20] disadvantage to the character, indicating that they have enough cyberware in their body that much worse things than simple power shutdown can occur - those being unconsciousness or seizures.
	
	While this does add extra book-keeping for the GM and player on low essence characters, the alternative is much worse! A player who ignores this and spends, say, 120 points on cyberware would gain back \textit{24 points!} This is \textit{more} than the value of the \textit{Electrical} disadvantage it is supposed to represent!!

	This headwaters provides a physical Fibre optic cable that directly connects a user's brain to a system. The cable is 5 yards long. Due to the nature of cable communications, most are not encrypted, however, users can add \textit{Secure, +20\%} [1]. This requires an eavesdropper to win a quick contest of IQ (if using Telecommunication) or Electronics Operations (Surveillance) versus your IQ or Expert Skill (Cybersecurity).

	This headware provides an encrypted, wireless, radio communicator that allows for a user to remotely connect their brain to a system. The datajack has a base range of 1 mile, but this may be affected by urban environments. As well, with connection to network access points, its traffic can hop (as any computer does) to other systems to allow access to any connected part of the Matrix, well outside its normal range. It is encrypted, requiring an eavesdropper to win a quick contest of IQ (if using Telecommunication) or Electronics Operation (Surveillance) versus your IQ or Expert Skill (Cybersecurity).

	\textit{Prerequisites: Datajack or Wireless Datajack}
	\begin{flushright}

	A Control Rig is the defining piece of equipment for a Rigger. This headware allows a user to jump into any system that he both has complete access to (legally or otherwise) and has a rigger adaption built into it. The rules for how Control Rigs interact with rigging are \hyperref[riggers]{covered in the Rigging and You section.}

	Skilljacks allow a user to make use of knowsofts and languosofts in order to take advantage of the dense expertise available through the software. 
	
	Each slot can hold a single Knowledge skill or Language advantage, with a maximum number of points equal to the Rating. Switching out a slot takes 1 second per point, from either downloading or installing and activating from memory. You can purchase this advantage multiple times to have multiple slots with their own ratings, and as many as you want can be active at a time.
	
	Knowsofts and Linguasofts can be purchased, usually for 100-1,000 Nuyen per point.

	\paragraph{Ultrasound Sensor}
	\begin{flushright}
		10 points
	\end{flushright}
	
	An Ultrasonic Sensor (Alternatively called Sonar, although there are some technical differences) projects waves of high frequency sound, picking up the echoes and using that to create a visual picture of the target.
	
	The sensor has a base range of 200 yards or 20 yards in air (multiplied by air pressure in atm). Each doubling of distance gives a -2 to sense rolls. The sensor has medium resolution, being able to spot small objects, but requires a Sense roll to determine fine relief such as faces.
	
	The frequency used is above the normal human range of hearing, but can be heard by those with the Ultrahearing advantage. Under ideal conditions it can be detected out to double its range with no penalty, however, environmental conditions can affect the sensor's capabilities and detection, ranging from -1 from being near noisy sea life to -6 for a busy harbor. The sensor does not work in vacuum.
	
	Ultrasound Sensors may be modified in a number of ways to better suite their objectives:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Targeting, +20\%. Allows for an aim maneuver to lock on to a spotted target, providing a +3 to aimed attacks for rangefinders.
		\item Low-Probability Intercept, +10\%. When turned on, halves range, but is detectable at 1.5× the halved range instead of double.
		\item

	Plastic Bone Lacing covers the external structure of your bones with composite polymer lattices, greatly enhancing their tensile strength alongside improving their impressive natural compression strength. It provides 1 DR to your whole body, with an additional 1 DR to your Skull. Alongside that, the reinforcement to your bones makes them usually resilient to crippling: the damage for crippling is \textit{doubled}, which affect dismemberment as well. Additionally, they cannot be permanently crippled. Finally, the reinforcements improve your unarmed damage, providing +1 to attacks with punches, kicks, etc.

	By inserting a mix of composite polymers and self-restoring ceramic plates onto the user's skin, their body can become much more durable. The implants provide DR 1, with higher levels increasing up to 6. However, the Ceramic materials can break down under high stress, following the semi-ablative rules.
	
	Optionally, the Ceramic composite platings can be replaced with more long lasting Steel materials. This removes semi-ablative rules, but add \textit{Nuisance Effect, Detectable by scanners, -5\%}, due to how Steel may be detected by certain scanners.

	Normal Cyberlimbs have limited armor thickness in order to minimally impact usability. However, those wishing to protect their investments often end up armoring them with thicker designs and more durable materials.
	
	The DR provided by this enhancement requires the location limitation as described in the \hyperref[cyberware-meta-trait]{Cyberware Meta-Trait section}, due to being able to armor multiple areas of the body differing amounts. Select the DR - limited from 1 to 9 with the Tough Skin limitation - that you want for the components and apply the location limitation for whichever locations are armored.

	Bioware enhancements are grown and tailored modifications that are biological in nature, tending to be both less invasive to the body alongside more expensive. Certain types of Bioware can sometimes be disrupted by targeted attacks on the body, in much the same way that one might "attack" a liver with alchohol, or the nervous system with a nerve gas; as such, Bioware that can be disrupted has the Bioware, -5\% Power Modifier.

	By flooding your system with specially designed adrenal chemicals, the user's adrenaline response can be greatly enhanced and called on demand. As a Free maneuver, the user can spend 4 FP to gain +1 ST (with no HP), Will, +0.25 Basic Speed, and Hard to Subdue 1. It takes 2 FP every minute to sustain it. 
	
	After shutting down, the implant requires 1 hour to regain its resources. 
	
	In periods of great stress you  must make a Will roll (a 14+ always fails), on a failure, your implant acts up, and after each uncontrolled act you get another Will roll to reassert control. The GM determines what happens during such an episode, but some suggestions are: refusals to activate, spontaneous activation, immediate recharge, and wasting FP
