	\subsection{'Ware \& Essence Rules}
	
	When replacing one's flesh with chrome and bioware, you lose a part of yourself - bit by bit. A metahuman has something intangible, that some Awakened call a soul, some call humanity, but is referred to as Essence. The more technology that is placed into a body, the less Essence it can retain. 
	
	This has a number of competing hypothesis (and traditions) for explanation, such as the soul being damaged, or the astral self not being able to connect to the complex technology as well as it does with a biological person. Regardless, those that lose their Essence tend to devolve into all manners of anti-social behaviour. Basically everything the APA could throw at you is on the table.
	
	When installing 'Ware, there are a variety of grades to choose from, ranging - from worst to best - Used up to Deltaware. Better grades generally providing cleaner installations that affect a customer's Essence less negatively, at the cost of a larger price tag. 
	
	Higher grades are also much more difficult to acquire, due to regulations restricting their use, secrecy regarding their technology and dissemination, and strong connections required to even access them. Betaware reduces LC by 1, while Deltaware reduces LC by 2.
	
	As to whether a piece is invasive or not is left to the GM, but general guidelines are to read their descriptions here or in Shadowrun's books and that it is usually the case for the expensive, shiny, pieces such as Wired Reflexes or Control Rigs.
	
	When the 'Ware is purchased, consult the 'Ware Modifier table for the grade, type, and invasiveness of the piece. Sum up all of the relevant modifiers. This number is used to determine what proportion of the piece's cost must be spent on Character Points versus with Nuyen. It does not include operating costs, if the GM chooses to use those.

	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Example: Rigger Joe takes a Control Rig R1, which is 44 Points. It’s definitely an “Invasive Ware” which gives -1, so the GM says he pays 9 of the 44 as Nuyen, costing 27,000¥ and uses 35 unspent CP for the remainder. }}
	
	After determining how many unspent points are going to be used 1/3 - 1/2 of those points must be taken as Disadvantages (For which the user can offset the CP cost of the 'Ware with). 
	
	Most often, these should be taken from Mental disadvantages having to deal with social and mental stability in some fashion, but you can also lose skills or advantages as is reasonable.
	
	Additionally, if the user has any Magic related Advantages, \textit{at least half} if not more of the disadvantages or points lost must be taken from the Magic Advantages or skills.
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Example: The GM decides that Joe must take 1/2 the cost in disadvantages. Now, Joe needs to take around 18 points in disadvantages. Firstly, he's become more of bumbling oaf since them, taking Oblivious [-5] and Noisy 2 [-4] for -9 points. He also decides that his newfound capabilities have made him reckless, taking On the Edge (SC 15, x1/2) [-8]. The GM decides that -17 points is good.}}
	
	\begin{wrapfigure}[12]{l}{85pt}
		
	\end{wrapfigure}
	
	Certain 'ware has point costs of very small points or even negative points, most often cyber-replacement parts due to their overall downsides. 
	
	For small costs, first look into options such as lowering Self-Control numbers, lowering social skills, or taking quirks. However, if those are not available, it is fine to change the proportions of CP and nuyen to either ignore CP costs as negligible.
	
	For negative point pieces, players should generally be encouraged to simply by enough enhancements to make it positive. However, it is important to point out that the Cyberware Meta-Trait will often accompany such cases, which must also be accounted for when determining the cost of the implant and will often cost enough to bring the total positive.
	
	If neither of these solutions are desireable for these two cases, the GM can lower the operation costs by 3,000¥ per character point, bringing the total higher overall. In the case of negative point 'ware, this can be used to assess essence disadvantages.
	
	Some players or GMs might be concerned about the idea that a character in the setting being able to afford relatively common cyberware such as a Datajack, given that they cost thousands of dollars. Don't forget that most people are making +50\% of TL8 wages first of all, but also do not forget that corporations have a vested incentive to make wageslaves indebted to them through expensive surgeries for mandatory job equipment (such as a Datajack)! If this is not convincing enough, the GM can always allow point debts to reduce costs, as detailed below.
	
	\subsubsection{Point Debts}
	
	To many players and GMs, it won't make sense that a character has to wait for Character Points in order to acquire 'ware they have cash for right now. In such a case, a GM can consider the option of Point Debts.
	
	Point Debts are where a player takes negative points equal to the CP cost of the 'Ware (after all necessary calculations), allowing them to take the piece of 'Ware without having the necessary points. 
	
	These negative points must be taken in disadvantages that represent certain short-term negatives associated with the 'ware. Usually, this is instances such as immune-rejection or blockers (Take Susceptibility to Disease, Wounded, etc), shoddy design or implantation that must be rectified (Lowered attributes, disadvantages associated with the cyberware's effects, etc), contracts that require follow-up visits (Maintenance), and so on. For players inventing their own 'ware, this can represent them making improvements to the equipment as time goes on, reducing side-effects and bugs. As the player acquires more points, these should be spent on removing these disadvantages, representing these short-term effects dissapearing with proper care, maintenance, or rectification.
	
	\subsubsection{Alternative Essence-Loss Disadvantages}
	
	While many normal disadvantages serve perfect for essence loss, there are a number of special cases that should be considered as options when adding essence loss:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep 0pt
		\item Vulnerability x2/x3/x4, Essence Loss Abilities (Rare) [-10/-15/-20] \newline
		Characters with very low essence are at high risk from abilities that drain essence, such as the \hyperref[essence_drain]{Essence Drain critter power.} Whenever they take damage from those sources, multiply it by the chosen amount. The GM Should consider enforcing this at certain milestones of essence loss, such as an additional level every -30 points.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Making Cyberware}
	
	Unlike our fleshy meat-bodies, cyberware has a wide variety of noteworthy advantages and disadvantages. These are represented by three important things: The Cyberware Meta-Trait, the Cyberware Power Modifiers, and the Cyberware Counter Advantages.
	
	\subsubsection{Cyberware Meta-Trait}\label{cyberware-meta-trait}
	
	Any part of a character's body that can be damage, need to take the Cyberware Meta-Trait. This is a collection of advantages that, in total, represent the features of chrome flesh.
	
	When taking the Meta-Trait, it must be limited to whatever parts of the body that are cybered up. GMS are advised to not use the \textit{Partial} modifier for damage resistance, due to its incapability to allow multiple differing hit locations; \textcolor{Blue}{\href{http://forums.sjgames.com/showpost.php?p=623207&postcount=1}{Kromm's Post on Partial DR for Hit Location}} is better, but also troublesome for having a very high minimum and low maximum that distort the values.
	
	Instead, I devised rules to allow the \textit{Partial} limitation to apply for multiple hit locations, which you can find in the \hyperref[partial]{Behind the Scenes section here.} While a table is provided below for ease of use, if you need to calculate some unique locations, check out that section for instructions on how to do so. Keep in mind that these are numerically generated, and while some are adjusted to keep things fair, the differences between two options might be so small that there's little difference (e.g. Both Hands versus Hands \& Feet); the GM should decide whether to allow certain limitations at each value in order to prevent players from just throwing on anything and everything they can. \textcolor{Blue}{\href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9vo3aBTs2W7UExsUEZGNjdJejg/view?resourcekey=0-pGjkVxQLp-67-iHB73z1dQ}{Check out Bruno's Grand Unified Hit Locations.}}
	
	\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\textit{Example: John is making a punk Character with two Cyberarms and Torso. He takes the Cyberware Meta-Trait with the \textit{Torso \& Two Limbs, -5\%} limitation applied to it. If he wanted something more complex, such as a cybered up Jaw, Torso, Forearms, and Hands, he would have to calculate the value for that himself as instructed in the Behind the Scenes section.}}

	\subsubsection*{Cyberware Meta-Trait}
	\begin{flushright}
		26 Points base\footnote{The cost will change drastically depending on the limitation. Do not just apply the limitation to the base cost. Do some math.}
	\end{flushright}
	\subparagraph{Advantages:}
	High Pain Threshold [10], Injury Tolerance (Unliving) [20], Injury Tolerance (Independant Body Parts) (Reattachment Only, -50\%; Nuisance Effect, Reattachement requires maintenance, -5\%)[16], Injury Tolerance (No Blood) [5], Resistant (Immunity, Metabolic Hazards) [30]
	\subparagraph{Disadvantages:}
	Reprogrammable [-10], Social Stigma (Valuable Property) [-10], Unhealing (Total) [-30], Unnatural Features (Detectable) [-5]
	
	\subsubsection{Cyberware Power Modifier}
	
	When creating advantages to represent Cybernetics, there are a number of effects that can interact with your Cyberware specifically, whether it be shutting it down, hacking it, or it just requiring maintenance. The collection of these limitations form the power modifier for Cyberware, although they are not likely to apply to every piece of cyberware.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown (Electrical), -20\%
		\item Maintenance (1 Person, Weekly or Monthly), -5\% or -3\% \footnote{Most 'ware in Shadowrun does not seem to require consistent maintenance, so this may only rarely apply.}
		\item Nuisance Effect (Detectable by Scanners), -5\%
		\item Mundane Countermeasures, -10\%\footnote{Only specific advantages will include mundane countermeasures. It only applies when normally accessible countermeasures can affect the power (such as a fire extinguisher putting out a burn innate attack). This often applies for advantages that can be jammed, spoofed, hacked or dos-ed, stopped by mundane equipment, or controlled.}
	\end{itemize}
	
	When you create or choose a cybernetic advantage, sum all of the respective modifiers and apply it to the advantage as necessary.
	
	For the purposes of this book I will use the following two power modifiers:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Technological, -35\%: (Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, Electrical,  -20\%; Mundane Countermeasures, -10\%; Nuisance Effect, Detectable by scanners, -5\%)
		\item Electrical, -25\%: (Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, Electrical, -20\%; Nuisance Effect, Detectable by scanners, -5\%)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Cyberware Counter Advantage}
	
	Certain pieces of Cyberware have notable negatives if they are shutdown, past the usual of shorting out, freaking out, or shutting down. The prime example of this is a Cyberarm, which, when shut down, would leave you with the One Arm disadvantage. 
	
	Advantages that are replaced with Disadvantages when the cyberware is disabled need to create a Counter Advantage Meta-Trait in order to represent this.
	
	This is done by creating a Meta-Trait that includes the Disadvantage and a mirror Advantage that negates it. The mirror Advantage must take any amount of Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown and Mundane Countermeasures limitations to represent the effects that make it stop working; often these are Electrical and Maintenance.
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Example: Jet Stream Sam is getting his first Cyberarm. He's already got his Meta-Trait and Power Modifier, now he needs his Counter Advantage. When his Cyberarm is shutdown, he will have the One Arm [-20] disadvantage. He builds the Counter Advantage to be: One Arm [-20] and NOT One Arm (Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, Electrical -20\%) [16] for a total Meta-Trait of [-4].}}
	
	\subsubsection{80+ Points of Cyberware and Power Modifiers}
	
	One issue that GM will have to keep an eye out is the inclusion of \textit{Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, Electrical} in the Cyberware Power Modifier! This is because, Temporary Disadvantages (B115) can only give back up to 80\% of the points for that disadvantage! As a simple example, if you take \textit{Altered Time Rate 1} [100] and slap \textit{Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, Electrical, -20\%} on it, it maxes out at -16\%.
	
	However, there is a second, more insidious case of this. If you were to take \textit{DX +2} [40], \textit{IQ +2} [26], and \textit{HT +2} [26] and put \textit{Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, Electrical, -20\%} on all of them, the total refund of \textbf{\textit{all}} Temporary Disadvantages cannot exceed 80\%. This means that instead of costing (40+26+26)$\times$80\% = [73.6], it instead refunds a max of 18 points = 76 points.
	
	If a character takes more than 80 base points in advantages that will have the Cybernetic Power Modifiers applied to them, the GM should restrict that to a maximum of 16 points returned. To make things simple (Especially if using the pre-built 'ware found in this book), they can add a +20\% enhancement to all cyberware advantages (i.e. remove the Temporary Disadvantage limitation) and simply add -16 points to the character (Which does not count against their disadvantage limit). Alternatively, they can simply add the \textit{Electrical} [-20] disadvantage to the character, indicating that they have enough cyberware in their body that much worse things than simple power shutdown can occur - those being unconsciousness or seizures.
	
	While this does add extra book-keeping for the GM and player on low essence characters, the alternative is much worse! A player who ignores this and spends, say, 120 points on cyberware would gain back \textit{24 points!} This is \textit{more} than the value of the \textit{Electrical} disadvantage it is supposed to represent!!
	
	As mentioned above, the player should be justified in rolling such an Electrical disadvantage into a Meta-Trait with his other powers (therefore not costing against their his disadvantage limit, just as Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown does).
	
	\subsubsection{Wireless vs Wired}
	
	Shadowrun made the jump to a wireless Matrix alongside some very.. dubious justifications for their increased efficacy. Of course, to make Deckers lives easier, the vast majority of people make use of entirely wireless equipment and 'ware - it's the exact same as in real life, convenience is too powerful. 
	
	However, as security specialists, one might wonder why the Decker still has his wi-fi turned on after seeing what he can do. If players wish to purchase non-wired equipment, it's relatively simple, just remove the \textit{Mundane Countermeasures, -10\%} limitation from any 'ware that includes \textit{Technological, -35\%}. 
	
	The increased point cost can be justified as older equipment with larger sizes and less refined techniques for preserving essence alongside greater cost for labor and rarity. Keep in mind that some 'ware \textit{cannot} remove this (e.g. Wireless Datajacks). 
	
	The GM is justified in adding additional \textit{Nuisance Effects, Temporary Disadvantages}, or other limiations such as annoying cables causing \textit{Klutz} or so on, reaction penalties for out-of date tech, loud cooling preventing stealth, fatigue cost from overheating, \textit{Unreliable} rolls, \textit{Maintenance} requirements, and so on all in the name of keeping costs similar.

	This headwaters provides a physical Fibre optic cable that directly connects a user's brain to a system. The cable is 5 yards long. Due to the nature of cable communications, most are not encrypted, however, users can add \textit{Secure, +20\%} [1]. This requires an eavesdropper to win a quick contest of IQ (if using Telecommunication) or Electronics Operations (Surveillance) versus your IQ or Expert Skill (Cybersecurity).

	This headware provides an encrypted, wireless, radio communicator that allows for a user to remotely connect their brain to a system. The datajack has a base range of 1 mile, but this may be affected by urban environments. As well, with connection to network access points, its traffic can hop (as any computer does) to other systems to allow access to any connected part of the Matrix, well outside its normal range. It is encrypted, requiring an eavesdropper to win a quick contest of IQ (if using Telecommunication) or Electronics Operation (Surveillance) versus your IQ or Expert Skill (Cybersecurity).

	A Control Rig is the defining piece of equipment for a Rigger. This headware allows a user to jump into any system that he both has complete access to (legally or otherwise) and has a rigger adaption built into it. The rules for how Control Rigs interact with rigging are \hyperref[riggers]{covered in the Rigging and You section.}

	Skilljacks allow a user to make use of knowsofts and linguasofts in order to take advantage of the dense expertise available through the software. 
	
	Each slot can hold a single Knowledge skill or Language advantage, with a maximum number of points equal to the Rating. Switching out a slot takes 1 second per point, from either downloading or installing and activating from memory. You can purchase this advantage multiple times to have multiple slots with their own ratings, and as many as you want can be active at a time.
	
	Knowsofts and Linguasofts can be purchased, usually for 100-1,000 Nuyen per point.

	\paragraph{Ultrasound Sensor}
	\begin{flushright}
		10 points
	\end{flushright}
	
	An Ultrasonic Sensor (Alternatively called Sonar, although there are some technical differences) projects waves of high frequency sound, picking up the echoes and using that to create a visual picture of the target.
	
	The sensor has a base range of 200 yards or 20 yards in air (multiplied by air pressure in atm). Each doubling of distance gives a -2 to sense rolls. The sensor has medium resolution, being able to spot small objects, but requires a Sense roll to determine fine relief such as faces.
	
	The frequency used is above the normal human range of hearing, but can be heard by those with the Ultrahearing advantage. Under ideal conditions it can be detected out to double its range with no penalty, however, environmental conditions can affect the sensor's capabilities and detection, ranging from -1 from being near noisy sea life to -6 for a busy harbor. The sensor does not work in vacuum.
	
	Ultrasound Sensors may be modified in a number of ways to better suite their objectives:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Targeting, +20\%. Allows for an aim maneuver to lock on to a spotted target, providing a +3 to aimed attacks for rangefinders.
		\item Low-Probability Intercept, +10\%. When turned on, halves range, but is detectable at 1.5× the halved range instead of double.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Statistics: Scanning Sense, Sonar (Increased Range, Land Only, ×10, +15\%; Reduced Range, ×1/10, -30\%; Technological, -35\%) [10]}}
	
	\paragraph{Voice Modulator}
	\begin{flushright}
		14 Points
	\end{flushright}

	An upgrade to the user's voice box, this implant gives them masterful control over their voice, providing perfect pitch, enormous vocal flexibility, and even distortion capabilities. This allows for many "mundane" uses, such a duplicating bird calls and wonderful singing, but also allows for duplicating gunshots and voices!
	
	The implant makes your voice naturally clear, resonant, and attractive, providing a +2 bonus to Diplomacy, Fast-Talk, Mimicry, Performance, Politics, Public Speaking, Sex Appeal, and Singing alongside a +2 Reaction Bonus made by people who can hear your voice. Additionally, the ability to talk at superhuman levels provides a +3 bonus to others Hearing rolls in situations where you want to be heard, which can sometimes provide a +1 to Intimidation rolls if it catches someone off guard!
	
	It also provides the ability to mimic any \textit{simple} sound, such as an alarm or gunshot by listening to it for one second and succeeding on an IQ roll. Voices require at least 10 seconds of listening and a successful IQ roll to mimic. Generally, this capability supersedes the Mimicry skill, however the GM may allow the +2 skill bonus to apply to the IQ rolls here as well.

	\end{flushright}
	
	Cybereyes replace your mk. 1 human eyeballs with digital optics. This provides you with built in Video Displays and DR 1 for the eyes.
	
	Cybereyes can take a large number of enhancements to further improve their capabilities: 
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Protected Vision (Technological, -35\%) [4]
		\item Reinforced Lenses 1-4 [1/2/3/4]
		\item Infravision (Technological, -35\%) [7]
		\item Ultravision (Technological, -35\%) [7]
		\item Hyperspectral Vision (Technological, -35\%) [13]
		\item Night Vision 1-9 (Technological, -35\%) [1/2/2/3/4/4/5/6/6]
		\item Acute Vision 1-3 (Technological, -35\%) [2/3/4]
		\item Telescopic Vision 1-2 (Temporary Disadvantage, Tunnel Vision, -30\%; Technological, -35\%) [2/4]
		\item Enhanced Tracking 1 (Technological, -35\%) [4]
		\item Smartgun (Accessory, Computer \& Software (C4 Guns Targeting Software and HUD Link)) [2]
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Protected Vision:} Digital and physical filters protect the user from visual based effects, providing +5 to all HT rolls to resist Vision effects.
	
	\textbf{Reinforced Lenses:} Strengthens the lenses and frames for the cybereyes. Provides the Nictating Membrane advantage for +1 DR per level to the Eyes alongside bonuses to resist certain visual effects.
	
	\textbf{Infravision:} Miniaturized infrared cameras allow the user to switch on Infrared Vision to see the \textcolor{Blue}{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared}{entire Infrared spectrum}}. Almost every object actively radiates out infrared light, with hotter objects glowing brighter; you can distinguish temperatures similarly to how normal vision distinguishes colour - although you \textit{cannot} see normal colours when it's active. This has some non obvious benefits, such as: many objects are translucent to IR, including many plastics and some fabrics, many sensors will heat up the walls and frames they are placed in, they will even be able to \textit{see} any \textit{active} millimeter-wave and terahertz detectors like flashlights (these are often used in portal scanners), and they can see IR lasers (which are commonly used for both communications and for lethal purposes). Remember that modern IR cameras \textit{do not} see in the whole spectrum, often only the Near-Infrared spectrum.
	
	
	This allows one to see in normal darkness with no penalties and even fight, just so long as those things emit heat! It also gives +2 to all Vision rolls to spot such targets, since they often stand out compared to the relatively cool background. When Tracking, heat will stick around for around an hour and provide +3 to Tracking rolls to follow this heat trail.
	
	Infrared Light is much lower resolution than Visible Light, only allowing you to judge the general size and shape of heat-emitting objects; Roll at -4 to distinguish objects of similar shape and size, such as most humans. You also cannot read text or computer screens unless the ink or pixels are a different temperature. This can occur for ink, where heat will reflect and absorb differently compared to the paper. Beware that bright flashes of heat can blind exactly like normal light, which can happen with plasma, explosions, flares, and so on.
	
	Being able to see in an expanded spectrum provides you with the capabilities of many fine-quality pieces of equipment, allowing you to claim bonuses as if you had such equipment. This provides a +2 to Naturalist and Prospecting (Due to differing heat spectra for materials and organisms), +2 to Artist (Pottery or Sculpting) and Metallurgy (Due to knowing precise temperatures), +2 to Vision-based Forensics, Observation, or Search Rolls (Due to heat causing evidence and objects of notice to stand out), and a +4 to Vision or Observation in Quick Contests against Camouflage or Disguise (Due to all of the materials only working against \textit{Visibile Light}, not Heat). Generally, you are able to notice any surface level cyberware with a successful Skill Roll as well, due to the metal and polymers emitting heat differently to flesh.
	
	The GM may allow for \textit{Near Infrared Vision} and \textit{Thermal Infrared Vision} options, as found in \GURPS Powers: Enhanced Senses p8.
	
	\textbf{Ultravision:} Modern miniaturized Ultraviolet Cameras allow the user to switch on Ultraviolet Vision to see the \textcolor{Blue}{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet}{entire UV spectrum}}. Many things emit UV light (see the \hyperref[sunlight]{Infected section on Sunlight for great detail}), including the Sun and most artificial lights. This allows them to see any \textit{active} UV sources, such as blacklights and UV lasers (uncommonly used in communications).
	
	Wherever it is present, the high resolution of UV light allows one to discern outlines, spot trace objects, identify objects, and more; this provides a +2 to all Vision rolls where UV light is present, alongside to Forensics, Observation, and Search rolls to spot clues or hidden objects.
	
	At night, there's enough UV light to ignore -2 in darkness penalties, and while this also applies to poorly lit buildings, windows do block the majority of UV light. It also penetrates much further through water; halve all vision penalties from water depth.
	
	Being able to see in an expanded spectrum provides you with the capabilities of many fine-quality pieces of equipment, allowing you to claim bonuses as if you had such equipment. This provides a +2 to Naturalist and Prospecting (Due to the differing absorption of UV light for many objects) and +4 to Vision or Observation in Quick Contests against Camouflage or Disguise (Due to the materials showing up much differently under UV light than Visible Light). You may be able to notice any surface level cyberware with a successful Skill Roll as well, due to the metal and polymers absorbing UV differently than flesh does.
	
	\textbf{Hyperspectral Vision:} The best of both worlds, Hyperspectral technology allows one to see both Infrared \textit{and} Ultraviolet light. It provides the same benefits and restrictions as the two options themselves provide, with the following changes: increase the bonus to Vision rolls and rolls to spot hidden clues with Forensics, Observation, or Search to +3; and Tracking always gains a +3 bonus now.
	
	If you are in an area that lacks light (or UV light in general), this works like Infravision above and vice versa if you (somehow) are in an area without Infrared light.
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Statistics: Accessory (Video Display) [1], Nictating Membrane 1 [1], Blindness [-50] and NOT Blindness (Technological, -35\%) [33]}}
	
	\textbf{Night Vision:} Enhanced light collection and enhancement allows the cybereyes to provide genuine Night Vision. Reduce penalties for darkness by 1 per level. This has no effect for -10 penalties as this is an \textit{absence} of light.
	
	\textbf{Acute Vision:} Optical improvements and digital enhancements improve the user's visual acuity and perception. This provides +1 to all Vision or Vision-based rolls for each level.
	
	\textbf{Telescopic Vision:} Advanced optic and digital designs allow for impressive levels of magnification to fit into something as small as an eyeball. Each level reduces all penalties for range to \textit{Vision rolls} by 1, or by double that if the user takes an Aim maneuver to concentrate on a specific previously spotted target. 
	
	Additionally, it can act like a variable-power scope and provide +1 Acc for each second of aiming, up to a maximum equal to this advantage's level. Notably, this \textit{is} cumulative with technological aids (lenses fucking stack goddammit), however the GM may rule you take additional darkness penalties equal to the lowest bonus of the two due to reduced light making it through.
	
	Notably, this design requires reducing your field of view to a small portion in order to focus the light. Whenever you are using this, you suffer from the Tunnel Vision disadvantage (B151), which reduces four FOV to 60 degrees.
	
	\textbf{Enhanced Tracking:} A favourite of dual-wielding gunbunnies, this software and physical upgrade allows the eyes to freely pivot and tracking additional targets at the same time. Your Aim or Evaluate maneuvers apply to one additional target whenever you take them. When using firearms you can only track as many targets with your Aim maneuver as you have ready weapons - you still need to be able to point the gun at each of them!
	
	\textbf{Smartgun:} Advanced firearms capabilities wired directly into your brain. Provides all of the benefits found in the \hyperref[smartgun]{Smartgun equipment section}, but the direct link to one's brain allows for Complexity 4 software to be run. This improves the Guns bonus to +3 and allow for tracking of \textit{1,000} targets of note.

	\textit{Prerequisites: Cyberware Meta-Trait on ears}
	\begin{flushright}
		-6 points
	\end{flushright}
	
	Cyberears replace the mk. 1 human ear with a digital version. They come with audio links, and if disabled leave you deaf.
	
	Cyberears can take a large number of enhancements to further improve their capabilities: 
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Protected Hearing (Technological, -35\%) [4]
		\item Subsonic Hearing (Technological, -35\%) [7]
		\item Ultrahearing (Technological, -35\%) [7]
		\item Discriminatory Hearing (Technological,-35\%) [10]
		\item Parabolic Hearing 1-2 (Technological, -35\%) [3/6]
		\item Acute Hearing 1-3 (Technological, -35\%) [2/3/4]
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Protected Hearing:} By adding filters, active noise cancellation, and similar technologies to the cyberears, protection against dangerous sounds can be improved. Provides +5 HT to rolls against Hearing based effects. Does not impact everyday hearing.
	
	\textbf{Subsonic Hearing:} The implant is able to hear very	low frequency sound waves (Below 40	Hz). These sounds are present in many large or heavy circumstances, including large weather events (tornadoes, hurricanes, etc), large ground events (earth	quakes, volcanoes, etc), large bodies of water moving (waves, waterfalls, etc.), large movements of creatures (from either large animals or a large number of them), many animals calls (whales, elephants, hippos, tigers, cats, etc.), sonic
	booms and explosions, and some machines (especially larger and mechanical ones).
	
	Wherever subsonic sounds are available, the user can make Sense rolls to notice and identify them as they would with normal hearing. The sounds themselves can travel around twice as far as normal sounds and penetrate through buildings, the ground, and water readily. This may provide bonuses to normal hearing, counting the source as being louder or closer than it would normally with standard hearing - or simply allow the check at a longer range. The power always provides a +1 bonus to Tracking if the quarry is moving over the ground. 
	
	Due to its fidelity and ease of use, it is able to stand in for fine-quality equipment in many cases, allowing you to claim bonuses even without the equipment. It provides +2 to Geology for detecting earthquakes, +2 to Meteorology, and +2 to Survival to locate large animals.
	
	\textbf{Ultrahearing:} The implant provides the ability to hear very high frequency sound waves (Above 20 kHz). This allows the user to hear things from dog whistles to sonar. 
	
	Sonar itself comes in many forms; bats use it for echolocation (although many other animals make sounds in the range too, such as dogs, birds, and crickets), some motion detectors use it (as opposed to IR), sonar rangefinders are an alternative to lasers, it is used for general sensors as well (ultrasounds, some anti-collision sensors, and so on). Like all passive detectors, the user may detect Active Sonar out to twice its effective range at no penalty.
	
	\textbf{Discriminatory Hearing:} The implant increases the resolution of hearing immensely, improving the ability to notice, distinguish, and differentiate between sounds of any kind. This allows the user to always distinguish between similar sounding, but unique objects, about as easily as a human can do by voice, via a single Hearing roll; they can differentiate between two car engines, or firearms, or so on. It allows for accurate remembering of such sounds too, requiring a minute and a successful IQ roll to commit to memory, and requiring 24 hours of wait on a failiure.
	
	This increase in resolution provides a +4 bonus to all Hearing rolls (effectively improving effective hearing to 8 times as far) and a +4 bonus to Shadowing noisy targets. It can also stand in for quality gear in certain circumstances.
	
	\textbf{Parabolic Hearing:} This implant allows for digital screening and physical shape and direction alterations that provide longer range detection of sounds.	
	
	Each level \textit{doubles} the distance at which a sound can be heard with no penalty (B358, P:ES21), effectively negating -1 in range modifiers per level. It also screens out background noises (HT158), either ignoring one source per level \textit{or} ignoring -2 in penalties per level (The GM should choose one and/or the other, as these are implied, but unofficial effects).
	
	\textbf{Acute Hearing:} General processing and sensitivity increases provided bonuses to the user's hearing. Add +1 to all Hearing and Hearing-Based rolls for each level.

	Plastic Bone Lacing covers the external structure of your bones with composite polymer lattices, greatly enhancing their tensile strength alongside improving their impressive natural compression strength. It provides 1 DR to your whole body, with an additional 1 DR to your Skull. Alongside that, the reinforcement to your bones makes them usually resilient to crippling: the damage for crippling is \textit{doubled}, which affect dismemberment as well. Additionally, they cannot be permanently crippled. Finally, the reinforcements improve your unarmed damage, providing +1 to attacks with punches, kicks, etc.

	By inserting a mix of composite polymers and self-restoring ceramic plates onto the user's skin, their body can become much more durable. The implants provide DR 1, with higher levels increasing up to 6. However, the Ceramic materials can break down under high stress, following the semi-ablative rules. Levels above 4 are LC 2.
	
	Optionally, the Ceramic composite platings can be replaced with more long lasting Steel materials. This removes semi-ablative rules, but add \textit{Nuisance Effect, Detectable by scanners, -5\%}, due to how Steel may be detected by certain scanners. This increases the point cost to 3/6/9/11/14/17 points.

	\paragraph{Internal Air Supply}
	\begin{flushright}
		5/7/9 points
	\end{flushright}
	
	The character is implant with a micro tank, holding compressed oxygen for the user. While activated, the system can provide all of the air supply for the user. Choking and strangulation cannot harm nor silence them and chemicals cannot affect if they rely in inhalation. The supply only lasts for a time, letting the user "hold their breath", depending on level: 50×, 100×, or 200× as long. For a normal HT 10 individual, this provides about 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours of time.
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Statistics: Doesn't Breath (Oxygen Storage, 50×, -40\%; Technological, -35\%) [5] further have Oxygen Storage, 100×, -30\% [7] and Oxygen Storage, 200×,-20\% [9].}}
	
	\paragraph{Reaction Enhancers}
	\begin{flushright}
		4/7/10/13 points
	\end{flushright}
	
	By replacing select parts of the central nervous system in the spine with faster mediums such as fibre optic transmitters, the user's movement and reaction speed to stimuli can be markedly improved.
	
	Each level provides +0.25 Basic Speed.
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Statistics: Basic Speed, +0.25 (Technological, -35\%) [4] further levels are Basic Speed, +0.5 [7], +0.75 [10], +1.0 [13].}}

	\begin{flushright}
		3/16/18/31 points
	\end{flushright}
	
	Vat grown synthetic muscles are used to either supplement or even replace the muscular system, alongside reinforcement of attachment points and supporting systems. Provides ample strength and dexterity, without increasing mass to an extreme degree.
	
	Each level provides +1 ST (with no HP) and every second level provides +1 DX (with no Basic Speed).
	
	Optionally, more dense fibres may be used that increase mass according to strength, removing the \textit{No HP, -2} on the ST. This increases the cost to [5/23/27/45].
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Statistics: ST +1 (No HP, -2; Technological, -35\%) [3] further levels are ST +2 [6] and DX +1 (No Basic Speed, -5; Technological, -35\%) [10], then ST +3 [8], and then ST +4 [11] and DX +2 [20].}}
	
	\paragraph{Skillwires}
	\textit{Prerequisites: Skilljack}
	\begin{flushright}
		6/8/10/12/14/16 points
	\end{flushright}
	
	Skillwires replace a Skilljack, acting as an addition to the original cyberware. Skillwires make use of Activesofts to allow for the physics feats, accomplished through the software itself. 
	
	Each slot can hold a single skill or Language advantage, with a maximum number of points equal to the Rating. Switching out a slot takes 1 second per point, from either downloading or installing and activating from memory. You can purchase this advantage multiple times to have multiple slots with their own ratings, and as many as you want can be active at a time.
	
	Knowsofts, Linguasofts, and Activesofts can be purchased, usually for 100-1,000 Nuyen per point.

	This extremely invasive procedure replaces large portions of the nervous system while implanting a series of adrenaline and stimulative systems, vastly enhancing the user's reflexes, providing +1.0 Basic Speed per level (with no Basic Move).
	
	The system can be exhausting to keep on, costing 1 FP for every minute. As well, while it is active the user appears twitchy and hyperactive, giving -1 to reactions. The last level is LC 2.

	Some versions have \textit{Electrical, -25\%} instead of \textit{Technological, -35\%}, and cost -20 Points total instead. These versions have no outfacing API and can generally not be hacked.
	
	A less eccentric option is always available, which is more of a 'case' than an actual cybernetic replacement. This version only includes Damage Resistance and costs [5] Points total. GM are entirely within their rights to restrict the amount of enhancements available to such an option, with a limit of under half the normal maximum recommended.

	Quite the eccentric choice, the character has decided to replace their skull, leaving only their brain untouched. Unlike many other cybernetic options, there isn't really a major downside here, as this is more metal than wire and does not replace many of the biological functions (Such as the brain itself). It is for this reason that it is often considered more of a partial replacement or cyberization. 
	
	The GM may choose to restrict certain traits in the Cyberware Meta-Trait for this option, such as Immunity to Metabolic Hazards, due to the impossibility of replacing the head entirely.
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Statistics: Damage Resistance 1 (Head, -45\%) [3].}}
	
		
	\subsubsection{Cyberlimb Enhancements}
	
	Cyberlimbs can be improved with a wide variety of enhancements, with some of them listed here. The GM should be relatively loose with what can be incorporated into limbs, as the list below is not exhaustive. Combine the value of the enhancements with the limb itself and the Cyberware Meta-Trait as one single Meta-Trait before calculating any grade or essence costs.

	\paragraph{Agility Enhancement}
	\textit{Prerequisites: Cyberlimb}
	\begin{flushright}
		6/12 or 8/16 points
	\end{flushright}
	
	This Enhancement greatly improves the dexterity of the Cyberlimb. If using limbs with different DX scores, use the lowest one. Combat skills use bodily DX, so this does not help. If you are buying this enhancement for 3 or more limbs, just buy bodily DX instead. 
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Statistics: Arm DX, One Arm +1-2 (Technological, -35\%) [6/12] or Arm DX, Two Arms +1-2 (Technological, -35\%) [8/16]}}
	
	\paragraph{Armoring}
	\textit{Prerequisites: Cyberware Meta-Trait}
	\begin{flushright}
		Var. points
	\end{flushright}
	
	Normal Cyberlimbs have limited armor thickness in order to minimally impact usability. However, those wishing to protect their investments often end up armoring them with thicker designs and more durable materials.
	
	The DR provided by this enhancement requires the location limitation as described in the \hyperref[cyberware-meta-trait]{Cyberware Meta-Trait section}, due to being able to armor multiple areas of the body differing amounts. Select the DR - limited from 1 to 9 - that you want for the components and apply the location limitation for whichever locations are armored.

	\subsection{Bioware}
	
	Bioware enhancements are grown and tailored modifications that are biological in nature, tending to be both less invasive to the body alongside more expensive. Certain types of Bioware can sometimes be disrupted by targeted attacks on the body, in much the same way that one might "attack" a liver with alchohol, or the nervous system with a nerve gas; as such, Bioware that can be disrupted has the Bioware, -5\% Power Modifier.

	\paragraph{Adrenaline Pump}
	\begin{flushright}
		14/23/32 points
	\end{flushright}
	
	By flooding your system with specially designed adrenal chemicals, the user's adrenaline response can be greatly enhanced and called on demand. As a Free maneuver, the user can spend 4 FP to gain +1 ST (with no HP), Will, +0.25 Basic Speed, and Hard to Subdue 1. It takes 2 FP every minute to sustain it. 
	
	After shutting down, the implant requires 1 hour to regain its resources. 
	
	In periods of great stress you  must make a Will roll (a 14+ always fails), on a failure, your implant acts up, and after each uncontrolled act you get another Will roll to reassert control. The GM determines what happens during such an episode, but some suggestions are: refusals to activate, spontaneous activation, immediate recharge, and wasting FP

	You have a small portion of your body hollowed out or in some way available to store equipment inside. Each level provides BL/10 lbs. of storage that is concealable to the naked eye (+9 to Holdout or similar skills). However, certain scanners negate the bonus and are much better suited to noticing it: decide whether the pocket is see through to scanners such as X-Rays or so on; if it is, the scanner will only be able to tell that you have the objects in or on you, but not that there is a pocket or how to access it. Alternatively, they cannot see into the pocket but are immediately aware of it and its construction, which makes is much easier to go about checking it.
	
	Additionally, you can only carry things that you reasonably could conceal. While a brick of styrofoam does technically meet the weight requirements it could not reasonably fit and a strobing light might shine through your skin (All as the GM rules).
	
	Maximum levels are up the GM and the player, although the Basic Set recommends looking closely at any more than 5 levels.

	\end{flushright}

	A cluster of specialized nervous tissue that is sometimes referred to as a neural block, it is designed to filter sensory stimuli in a way to prevent almost any sense of pain - and often touch as well. The implant can be turned off or on at any time with a Ready action.
	
	By filtering out these stimuli alongside adding in additional ones of its own, the implant is able to prevent any sense of pain from reaching the user. This means they \textit{never} suffer shock penalties and get a +8 to all HT rolls to avoid knockdown and stunning, physical torture, resist painful or stunning afflictions, and to rolls to recover being physically stunned. 
	
	This also makes them \textit{very} hard to subdue, providing +4 to all HT rolls to avoid unconsciousness or death. If this bonus is the difference between life and death, the user seems to die (A successful Diagnosis roll revealing the truth), but will recover as normally.
	
	These effects (alongside the other stimuli) tend to greatly boost the morale of the subject, providing +1 Will while active. It's not unheard of for user to develop the \textit{Megalomania} disadvantage.
	
	This does come with a downside however; limiting this much physical input makes it very difficult to operate by touch to any real degree. This causes the user to have no appreciable sense of touch, although they can vaguely feel pressure - enough to stand and walk and so on. This of course makes feats of touch impossible, such as touch-typing or untying your hands behind your back. 
	
	Additionally, the user will suffer from one level of \textit{Ham Fisted} (B138) (stacking with the normal disadvantage) unless they take \textit{double} the time performing the action \textit{and} can clearly see what they are doing. This incurs a -3 penalty to do fine work with any skill listed under \textit{High Manual Dexterity} (B59) and Fast-Draw. It also tends to make the user generally more messy, incurring a -1 to Influence or Reaction rolls at the GM's discretion.
	
	Certain dangerous versions of this ware \textit{utterly remove} any sense of pain. Instead of providing the bonus to resist pain-based effects, the user is \textit{entirely immune} to knockdown and stunning, physical torture, pain, and physical stunning. Such implants cost a total of [41] points instead. The GM in within their rights to enforce even worse \textit{Temporary Disadvantages} than \textit{Numb} for such bioware.
