	\subsection{'Ware \& Essence Rules}
	
	When replacing one's flesh with chrome and bioware, you lose a part of yourself - bit by bit. A metahuman has something intangible, that some Awakened call a soul, some call humanity, but is referred to as Essence. The more technology that is placed into a body, the less Essence it can retain. 
	
	This has a number of competing hypothesis (and traditions) for explanation, such as the soul being damaged, or the astral self not being able to connect to the complex technology as well as it does with a biological person. Regardless, those that lose their Essence tend to devolve into all manners of anti-social behaviour. Basically everything the APA could throw at you is on the table.
	
	When installing 'Ware, there are a variety of grades to choose from, ranging - from worst to best - Used up to Deltaware. Better grades generally providing cleaner installations that affect a customer's Essence less negatively, at the cost of a larger price tag. 
	
	Higher grades are also much more difficult to acquire, due to regulations restricting their use, secrecy regarding their technology and dissemination, and strong connections required to even access them. Betaware reduces LC by 1, while Deltaware reduces LC by 2.
	
	As to whether a piece is invasive or not is left to the GM, but general guidelines are to read their descriptions here or in Shadowrun's books and that it is usually the case for the expensive, shiny, pieces such as Wired Reflexes or Control Rigs.
	
	When the 'Ware is purchased, consult the 'Ware Modifier table for the grade, type, and invasiveness of the piece. Sum up all of the relevant modifiers. This number is used to determine what proportion of the piece's cost must be spent on Character Points versus with Nuyen. It does not include operating costs, if the GM chooses to use those.

	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Example: Rigger Joe takes a Control Rig R1, which is 44 Points. It’s definitely an “Invasive Ware” which gives -1, so the GM says he pays 9 of the 44 as Nuyen, costing 27,000¥ and uses 35 unspent CP for the remainder. }}
	
	Additionally, after determining how many unspent points are going to be used 1/3 - 1/2 of those points must be taken as Disadvantages (For which the user can offset the CP cost of the 'Ware with). 
	
	Most often, these should be taken from Mental disadvantages having to deal with social and mental stability in some fashion, but you can also lose skills or advantages as is reasonable.
	
	Additionally, if the user has any Magic related Advantages, \textit{at least half} if not more of the disadvantages or points lost must be taken from the Magic Advantages or skills.
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Example: The GM decides that Joe must take 1/2 the cost in disadvantages. Now, Joe needs to take around 18 points in disadvantages. Firstly, he's become more of bumbling oaf since them, taking Oblivious [-5] and Noisy 2 [-4] for -9 points. He also decides that his newfound capabilities have made him reckless, taking On the Edge (SC 15, x1/2) [-8]. The GM decides that -17 points is good.}}

	Certain 'ware has point costs of very small points or even negative points, most often cyber-replacement parts due to their overall downsides. 
	
	For small costs, first look into options such as lowering Self-Control numbers, lowering social skills, or taking quirks. However, if those are not available, it is fine to change the proportions of CP and nuyen to either ignore CP costs as negligible when this small or Nuyen costs as completely dwarfed by operation costs.
	
	For negative point pieces, players should generally be encouraged to simply by enough enhancements to make it positive. However, it is important to point out that the Cyberware Meta-Trait will often accompany such cases, which must also be accounted for when determining the cost of the implant and will often cost enough to bring the total positive.
	
	If neither of these solutions are desireable for these two cases, the GM can lower the operation costs by 3,000¥ per character point, bringing the total higher overall. In the case of negative point 'ware, this can be used to assess essence disadvantages.
	
	Some players or GMs might be concerned about the idea that a character in the setting being able to afford relatively common cyberware such as a
	
	\subsection{Making Cyberware}
	
	Unlike our fleshy meat-bodies, cyberware has a wide variety of noteworthy advantages and disadvantages. These are represented by three important things: The Cyberware Meta-Trait, the Cyberware Power Modifiers, and the Cyberware Counter Advantages.
	
	\subsubsection{Cyberware Meta-Trait}
	
	Any part of a character's body that can be damage, need to take the Cyberware Meta-Trait. This is a collection of advantages that, in total, represent the features of chrome flesh.
	
	When taking the Meta-Trait, it must be limited to whatever parts of the body that are cybered up. This must use \textcolor{Blue}{\href{http://forums.sjgames.com/showpost.php?p=623207&postcount=1}{Kromm's Post on Partial DR for Hit Location}}. Here are some pre-made limitations for ease-of-use:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em 
		\item Skull: -40\%
		\item Face: -40\%
		\item Eyes: -45\%
		\item Ears: -45\%
		\item One Limb: -35\%
		\item Two Limbs: -30\%
		\item Three Limbs: -25\%
		\item Four Limbs: -20\%
		\item Torso: -25\%
		\item Torso and Four Limbs: -5\%
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection*{Cyberware Meta-Trait}
	\begin{flushright}
		26 Points base\footnote{The cost will change drastically depending on the limitation. Do not just apply the limitation to the base cost. Do some math.}
	\end{flushright}
	\subparagraph{Advantages:}
	High Pain Threshold [10], Injury Tolerance (Unliving) [20], Injury Tolerance (Independant Body Parts) (Reattachment Only, -50\%; Nuisance Effect, Reattachement requires maintenance, -5\%)[16], Injury Tolerance (No Blood) [5], Resistant (Immunity, Metabolic Hazards) [30]
	\subparagraph{Disadvantages:}
	Reprogrammable [-10], Social Stigma (Valuable Property) [-10], Unhealing (Total) [-30], Unnatural Features (Detectable) [-5]
	
	\subsubsection{Cyberware Power Modifier}
	
	When creating advantages to represent Cybernetics, there are a number of effects that can interact with your Cyberware specifically, whether it be shutting it down, hacking it, or it just requiring maintenance. The collection of these limitations form the power modifier for Cyberware, although they are not likely to apply to every piece of cyberware.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown (Electrical), -20\%
		\item Maintenance (1 Person, Weekly or Monthly), -5\% or -3\% \footnote{Most 'ware in Shadowrun does not seem to require consistent maintenance, so this may only rarely apply.}
		\item Nuisance Effect (Detectable by Scanners), -5\%
		\item Mundane Countermeasures, -10\%\footnote{Only specific advantages will include mundane countermeasures. It only applies when normally accessible countermeasures can affect the power (such as a fore extinguisher putting out a burn innate attack). This often applies for advantages that can be jammed, spoofed, hacked or dos-ed, stopped by mundane equipment, or controlled.}
	\end{itemize}
	
	When you create or choose a cybernetic advantage, sum all of the respective modifiers and apply it to the advantage as necessary.
	
	For the purposes of this book I will use the following two power modifiers:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Technological, -35\%: (Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, Electrical,  -20\%; Mundane Countermeasures, -10\%; Nuisance Effect, Detectable by scanners, -5\%)
		\item Electrical, -25\%: (Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, Electrical, -20\%; Nuisance Effect, Detectable by scanners, -5\%)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Cyberware Counter Advantage}
	
	Certain pieces of Cyberware have notable negatives if they are shutdown, past the usual of shorting out, freaking out, or shutting down. The prime example of this is a Cyberarm, which, when shut down, would leave you with the One Arm disadvantage. 
	
	Advantages that are replaced with Disadvantages when the cyberware is disabled need to create a Counter Advantage Meta-Trait in order to represent this.
	
	This is done by creating a Meta-Trait that includes the Disadvantage and a mirror Advantage that negates it. The mirror Advantage must take any amount of Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown and Mundane Countermeasures limitations to represent the effects that make it stop working; often these are Electrical and Maintenance.
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Example: Jet Stream Sam is getting his first Cyberarm. He's already got his Meta-Trait and Power Modifier, now he needs his Counter Advantage. When his Cyberarm is shutdown, he will have the One Arm [-20] disadvantage. He builds the Counter Advantage to be: One Arm [-20] and NOT One Arm (Temporary Disadvantage, Shutdown, -20\%) [16] for a total Meta-Trait of [-4].}}

	This headwaters provides a physical Fibre optic cable that directly connects a user's brain to a system. The cable is 5 yards long. Due to the nature of cable communications, most are not encrypted, however, users can add \textit{Secure, +20\%} [1]. This requires an eavesdropper to win a quick contest of IQ (if using Telecommunication) or Electronics Operations (Surveillance) versus your IQ or Expert Skill (Cybersecurity).

	\begin{flushright}
		10 points
	\end{flushright}
	
	This headware provides an encrypted, wireless, radio communicator that allows for a user to remotely connect their brain to a system. The datajack has a base range of 1 mile, but this may be affected by urban environments. As well, with connection to network access points, its traffic can hop (as any computer does) to other systems to allow access to any connected part of the Matrix, well outside its normal range. It is encrypted, requiring an eavesdropper to win a quick contest of IQ (if using Telecommunication) or Electronics Operation (Surveillance) versus your IQ or Expert Skill (Cybersecurity).

	\textit{Prerequisites: Datajack or Wireless Datajack}
	\begin{flushright}
		44/59/74 points
	\end{flushright}
	
	A Control Rig is the defining piece of equipment for a Rigger. This headware allows a user to jump into any system that he both has complete access to (legally or otherwise) and has a rigger adaption built into it. The rules for how Control Rigs interact with rigging are \hyperref[riggers]{covered in the Rigging and You section.}

	Skilljacks allow a user to make use of knowsofts and languosofts in order to take advantage of the dense expertise available through the software. 
	
	Each slot can hold a single Knowledge skill or Language advantage, with a maximum number of points equal to the Rating. Switching out a slot takes 1 second per point, from either downloading or installing and activating from memory. You can purchase this advantage multiple times to have multiple slots with their own ratings, and as many as you want can be active at a time.
	
	Knowsofts and Linguasofts can be purchased, usually for 100-1,000 Nuyen per point.

	\paragraph{Ultrasound Sensor}
	\begin{flushright}
		10 points
	\end{flushright}
	
	An Ultrasonic Sensor (Alternatively called Sonar, although there are some technical differences) projects waves of high frequency sound, picking up the echoes and using that to create a visual picture of the target.
	
	The sensor has a base range of 200 yards or 20 yards in air (multiplied by air pressure in atm). Each doubling of distance gives a -2 to sense rolls. The sensor has medium resolution, being able to spot small objects, but requires a Sense roll to determine fine relief such as faces.
	
	The frequency used is above the normal human range of hearing, but can be heard by those with the Ultrahearing advantage. Under ideal conditions it can be detected out to double its range with no penalty, however, environmental conditions can affect the sensor's capabilities and detection, ranging from -1 from being near noisy sea life to -6 for a busy harbor. The sensor does not work in vacuum.
	
	Ultrasound Sensors may be modified in a number of ways to better suite their objectives:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Targeting, +20\%. Allows for an aim maneuver to lock on to a spotted target, providing a +3 to aimed attacks for rangefinders.
		\item Low-Probability Intercept, +10\%. When turned on, halves range, but is detectable at 1.5× the halved range instead of double.
		\item

	Plastic Bone Lacing covers the external structure of your bones with composite polymer lattices, greatly enhancing their tensile strength alongside improving their impressive natural compression strength. It provides 1 DR to your whole body, with an additional 1 DR to your Skull. Alongside that, the reinforcement to your bones makes them usually resilient to crippling: the damage for crippling is \textit{doubled}, which affect dismemberment as well. Additionally, they cannot be permanently crippled. Finally, the reinforcements improve your unarmed damage, providing +1 to attacks with punches, kicks, etc.

	This Enhancement greatly improves the dexterity of the Cyberlimb. If using limbs with different DX scores, use the lowest one. Combat skills use bodily DX, so this does not help. If you are buying this enhancement for 3 or more limbs, just buy bodily DX instead.

	\paragraph{Armoring}
	\textit{Prerequisites: Cyberware Meta-Trait}
	\begin{flushright}
		Var. points
	\end{flushright}
	
	Normal Cyberlimbs have limited armor thickness in order to minimally impact usability. However, those wishing to protect their investments often end up armoring them with thicker designs and more durable materials.
	
	The DR provided by this enhancement requires the location limitation as described in the TODO Cyberware Meta-Trait section, due to being able to armor multiple areas of the body differing amounts. Select the DR - limited from 1 to 9 with the Tough Skin limitation - that you want for the components and apply the location limitation for whichever locations are armored.
	
	Here are some examples:

	\subsection{Bioware}
	
	Bioware enhancements are grown and tailored modifications that are biological in nature, tending to be both less invasive to the body alongside more expensive. Certain types of Bioware can sometimes be disrupted by targeted attacks on the body, in much the same way that one might "attack" a liver with alchohol, or the nervous system with a nerve gas; as such, Bioware that can be disrupted has the Bioware, -5\% Power Modifier.

	\paragraph{Adrenaline Pump}
	\begin{flushright}
		15/24/34 points
	\end{flushright}
	
	By flooding your system with specially designed adrenal chemicals, the user's adrenaline response can be greatly enhanced and called on demand. As a Free maneuver, the user can spend 4 FP to gain +1 ST (with no HP), Will, +0.25 Basic Speed, and Hard to Subdue 1. It takes 2 FP every minute to sustain it. 
	
	After shutting down, the implant requires 1 hour to regain its resources. 
	
	In periods of great stress you  must make a Will roll (a 14+ always fails), on a failure, your implant acts up, and after each uncontrolled act you get another Will roll to reassert control. The GM determines what happens during such an episode, but some suggestions are: refusals to activate, spontaneous activation, immediate recharge, and wasting FP

	By increasing the density and tensile strength of the bones, you can greatly increase the body's capabilities to resist damage. The stronger bones provide +1 HT (and derived attributes) alongside +1 DR and HP for every level. As well, it increases the strength of unarmed attacks, providing +1 damage per die to kicks, punches, etc.
