\section{Resonance}

\begin{multicols*}{3}
	
	\subsection{Resonance Power}
	
	Resonance is a power that allows users to manipulate computer software using - to the best of metahumanity's determination - just their mind. Emerged users, while focused in differing specialties, all have the ability to interface with the Matrix and computers via radio waves believed to be generated by their mind, generally referred to as their Living Persona.
	
	How they do so is still up to series debate, even after the inhumane experiments done by corporations like Horizon, ranging from a special, Matrix derived Metaplane, to the ghost of hundreds of dead Technomancers, to the gestalt consciousness of humanity, to the inhumane influence of the true AIs.
	
	Whatever the reason, Technomancers are (apparently) here to stay now, unlike their predecessors the Otaku, and their capabilities are not to be taken lightly.
	
	For most intents and purposes, a Living Persona seems to work like a normal computer or datajack that lacks media storage. It can be jammed, hacked, shut off, execute programs on other computers, perform VR, be stopped by lead paint, etc. 
	
	However, some resonance based powers called Complex Forms seem to only partially play by the rules of the Matrix. These powers cannot be jammed, hacked, etc., unlike their cousin abilities for the Emerged. As long as the user can make any connection to a computer, these abilities can be used regardless of the mundane circumstances. This is somewhat limited however by the fact that Complex Forms tend to be reliant on other abilities that \textit{are} susceptible to these effect, and by the dangerous Fading that Emerged receive when using such powers.
	
	As such, there are two power modifiers that are used for Resonance (both of which Resonance improves the abilities of):
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Resonance, -15\%; (Mundane Countermeasures, -10\%; Supernatural Countermeasures, -5\%)
		\item Complex Form, -5\%; (Supernatural Countermeasures, -5\%)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Emerged Types}
	
	\paragraph{Emerged}\label{emerged}
	\begin{flushright}
		27 Points
	\end{flushright}
	
	An Emerged character, colloquially known as Technomancers - or many years ago Otaku, although it is still up to debate whether they are one and the same - has the ability to manifest a Living Persona and connect to computers using only their brain.
	
	This meta-trait allows you to communicate using Radio on \textit{any and all} standard communication frequencies used for the Matrix. This is somewhat more expansive than a normal computer, including cases such as AM/FM Radio, GPS and Satellite, etc. To do so, make a Concentrate maneuver and succeed a Computer Operation + Resonance  to establish a communication link. For certain secure boxes, this may require some scanning or detection to determine in what ways they will even begin to communicate! It's also possible to maintain multiple contacts, with a cumulative -1 to the roll for each contact past the first.
	
	However, it does not include communication with radio in ways and frequencies not used for Matrix communication, such as Radar and other detection formats, certain types of navigation and obtuse communications, etc. When in doubt, most radio communication systems should be included by the GM.
	
	Your ability has a range of 2 miles, although it can connect to further locations by hopping along networks (As normal computers do), so it only has to be in range of a computer or network that can pass along the data (Which, given the ubiquity of wireless computers in the Sixth World, is not very hard outside of a Z Zone).
	
	You can transfer information in any format, encoding, and so on - although this does not grant you the ability to read formats that are protected, such as encryption and ciphers. As well, you may transfer any information from your senses in such a way.
	
	The communication is also secure, preventing any spying or eavesdropping unless the opponent wins a quick contest of IQ (only if using Telecommunication, such as with this power) or Electronics Operation (Surveillance) versus your IQ or Expert Skill (Cybersecurity), adding any Resonance to either rolls.
	
	Additionally, while on the Matrix, the user counts as a digital consciousness - which is to say their brain acts like a computer. This allows the Emerged to interact with the Matrix as if they were a computer themselves. For game purposes, they have a Complexity equal to 2 + Resonance.
	
	Their Matrix minds are immune to Mind Control or any telepathic powers alongside spells that affect living minds, however they can be hacked, damaged, taken offline, and more by digital threats and viruses (Although not reprogrammed, they lack that disadvantage!). 
	
	Unlike AI, the Technomancer can only run on their own mind, unable to duplicate, backup, or transfer their digital minds between machines - although they can still move around and interact with hosts and networks as normal. They are unable to actually reside inside (read: possess) computers like riggers (without a specific Submersion) or AI, so they both do not immediately gain control of resident systems, nor are trapped inside them should their matrix connectivity be shut off, they function like a deck would - lose connection to the host it was currently "inside" and interacting with, which can still be damaging!
	
	While his normal ways of interacting with the Matrix are complex and intuitive enough to count as Basic VR, the Technomancer is also able to enter a trancelike state to enter the Matrix at any time, exactly as if using Total VR. When in this trance, the Emerged always counts as using \hyperref[sim_mode]{Hot-Sim}, no matter what.
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Statistics: Digital Mind (Accessibility, Only on Matrix, -40\%) [5]; Telecommunication, Radio (Requires (Computer Operation), +5\%; Secure, +20\%, Sensie, +80\%; Accessibility (Only frequencies used for Matrix), -20\%; Reduced Range, x1/5, -20\%; Resonance, -15\%) [15]; Unsusual Background [5]; Accessory, Total VR (Cosmic, Does not take program slots, +50\%; Cosmic, Ignores Complexity limits, +50\%) [2]\footnote{See the Resonance Program advantage below as an example of how this works.}}}
	
	\subsection{Using a Living Persona}
	
	Emerged's consciousness represent themselves  on the Matrix as living persona. These can take almost any form possible, and often tend to be more intricate, detailed, realistic, or so on compared to other icons on the matrix (Although not enough to reliably distinguish them). 
	
	Their persona allows them to exist on the matrix in the same way as a Commlink or similar device, with their Living Persona acting as their icons on the wider Matrix. They are also able to perform any standard actions expected of a computer with wireless capabilities, be it searching, communicating, browsing the Matrix, writing and editing files, executing programs, and so on. 
	
	Their Persona lacks any media storage, which makes them unable to physically store files, paydata, programs, and so on. However, they can easily stream data from one source to a device of theirs, such as a commlink. This does however, mean that they are unable to innately perform hacking actions using the GURPS \#3/21 - Cyberpunk hacking programs, as they would only be able to execute them through other computers be default.
	
	The standard way to run hacking (or any programs, should the technomancer wish to run DOOM in his brain!), is to purchase the \hyperref[resonance_program]{Resonance Program advantage} from below, which allows him to run the program as if installed on his Digital Mind.
	
	Secondly, most Complex Forms and the Technomancer's Emerged trait double up as programs for the use of one or more hacking programs (The GM is encouraged to consider their use for non-hacking programs too, such as Puppeteer being used for IT Remote Desktop software). However, many of these powers only provide this benefit in situations that are close to their normal abilities (e.g. Listen can be gained through Emerged and Wiretap, however Emerged covers network traffic, while Wiretap covers all network, digital, electrical, and so on). These restrictions are taken, but altered from Pyramid \#3/91 - Thaumatology IV, which is further described in \hyperref[behind_the_screen]{the Behind the Screen section on Resonance.}
	
	\paragraph{Alter}
	\begin{center}
		\textit{Power: \hyperref[editor]{Editor lvl 2}}
	\end{center}

	With the form that gives the Emerged write and execute permissions on files, they can perform the functionality for Alter.

	\paragraph{Analyze}
	\begin{center}
		\textit{Power: \hyperref[editor]{Editor lvl 1} and }
	\end{center}

	\paragraph{Breach}
	\begin{center}
		\textit{Power: \hyperref[emerged]{Emerged}}
	\end{center}

	Any Emerged can slam enough traffic and attacks to brute force crash some ICE. Additionally, they add an IQ-2 to the list of defaults for the Breach program when run through their Living Persona.
	
	\paragraph{Control}
	\begin{center}
		\textit{Power: \hyperref[emerged]{Emerged} and \hyperref[puppeteer]{Puppeteer}}
	\end{center}

	By default, an Emerged is able to issue general commands to computers and systems within normal expectations, which allows them to use the Control program for any mundane usage. Puppeteer allows the Emerged to also perform unorthodox commands, outside the normal bounds of operation for the systems they interact with (e.g. overriding a drone's controls, switching an RFID safety system off when looking at foes, and so on).
	
	\paragraph{Damage}
	\begin{center}
		\textit{Power: \hyperref[resonance_spike]{Resonance Spike}}
	\end{center}

	The Damage program is simply a more straightforward and brutish approach to the same objective compared to the Resonance Spike ability. The only difference, being the program can target the minds of creatures. As such, all uses for the Damage program work with the Resonance Spike power.
	
	\paragraph{ICE}
	\begin{center}
		\textit{Power: \hyperref[emerged]{Emerged}}
	\end{center}

	An Emerged is fully capable of filtering incoming and outgoing traffic using their natural abilities, allowing them to run the ICE program as normal. Additionally, they add Will to the list of defaults for the ICE program when run through their Living Persona.
	
	\paragraph{Jam}
	\begin{center}
		\textit{Power: \hyperref[emerged]{Emerged} and \hyperref[pulse_storm]{Pulse Storm}}
	\end{center}

	For wide-spectrum jamming (read: jamming every frequency in an area around you), the \hyperref[emerged]{Emerged}'s normal capabilities suffice, allowing them to use the Jam program for that use case. For jamming that targets a specific icons, covers only certain frequencies, or is otherwise any more complex, the Emerged requires the more powerful \hyperref[pulse_storm]{Pulse Storm} form.
	
	\paragraph{Link-Lock}
	\begin{center}
		\textit{Power: \hyperref[resonance_spike]{Resonance Spike}}
	\end{center}

	In the same fashion that the Emerged is able to send dangerous data through to devices with the Resonance Spike power, this can also be toned down for a long term and insidious signal that forces users to remain connected to the Matrix. Emerged with the Resonance Spike form. can also use it for the Link-Lock program.
	
	\paragraph{Listen}
	\begin{center}
		\textit{Power: \hyperref[emerged]{Emerged} and \hyperref[wiretap]{Wiretap}}
	\end{center}

	\hyperref[emerged]{Emerged} includes the ability to communication over radio, which covers any wireless Listen use cases. Alternatively the \hyperref[wiretap]{Wiretap} Complex Form covers \textit{any} wireless, electrical, or digital Listen use cases, which does include using it to monitor software, such as ICE, on the same computer.
	
	\paragraph{Search}
	\begin{center}
		\textit{Power: \hyperref[editor]{Editor lvl 1} and}
	\end{center}

	\hyperref[editor]{Editor}'s first level allows the Emerged to search and probe through data systems and files, which can also be used at a lower power as the Search program for the purposes of searching any single software icon, such as a file, database, or so on. For searching networks, the Emerged needs the TODO Power.
	
	\paragraph{Spoof}
	\begin{center}
		\textit{Power: \hyperref[puppeteer]{Puppeteer}}
	\end{center}


	Similarly to controlling the inputs and outputs of a device, Pupeteer can also be used as a normal Spoof program to do so for a software. This doesn't grant any capabilities to use the Pupeteer Complex Form outside its normal restrictions still (e.g. no Pupeteering ICE), although you can still often Pupeteer a device to perform a software action anyways.

	\paragraph{Stealth}
	\begin{center}
	\textit{Power: \hyperref[static_bomb]{Static Bomb}}
	\end{center}
	
	The Emerged is capable of using the Static Bomb program for long lasting and low-powered obfuscation, allowing them to use it to run the Stealth program.
	
	\paragraph{Trigger}
	\begin{center}
	\textit{Power: \hyperref[emerged]{Emerged}}
	\end{center}

	The Emerged's brain is naturally able to function like a normal computer, which includes all cases of calling and executing actions and programs based on pre-planned instructions, e.g. the entire Trigger program.

	Resonance is the core for your unnatural abilities as an Emerged. Add your Resonance to all rolls to use \textbf{Complex Forms} well; this means all Complex Form skills, activation rolls, etc. As well, the GM should look for ways to apply a bonus indirectly to passive abilities, as described in GURPS Supers p22.
	
	Your Resonance also serves as a cap for various resonance advantages: For Threading, Compiling, and Registering, you can only buy Levels up to your Resonance level.
	
	When purchasing resonance advantages, you must only pay full cost for your most expensive Complex Form; for all other ones you pay only 1/5 cost. However, you can only sustain one Complex Form at a given time (although you may have multiple instances of that Complex Form if applicable); if you want to sustain multiple different effects, you must pay full price for each of your next most expensive Complex Form for the amount of additional effects you wish to sustain.
	
	When threading Complex Forms, you must make two Concentrate maneuvers (or only one, if the last Complex Form used is the same one).

	\paragraph{Resonance Program}
	\textit{Prerequisite: \hyperref[emerged]{Emerged}}
	\begin{flushright}
		2 Points
	\end{flushright}

	The Technomancer is able to run a specific program through his Living Persona as if it were a normal computer. It can be run at any complexity from its minimum up to the complexity of their Persona (3 + Resonance), chosen when loaded.
	
	The Technomancer is still subject to computer restrictions like normal, including Complexity limiting the amount of programs they can run, interface modes affecting skill levels, programs needing to be invoked, and so on.
	
	Many Technomancer advantages provide the corresponding Resonance Program advantage for free (as shown above), including all the benefits as seen here; the Technomancer should only purchase this for programs that they do not have corresponding advantages for.

	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Statistics: Accessory, Program (Cosmic, Can change Complexity, +50\%; Complex Form, -5\%) }}
	
	\subsection{Complex Forms}
	
	\subsubsection{Using Complex Forms}
	
	Complex Forms are one of the secret spices to an Emerged's capabilities, allowing them to interact with the Matrix and its denizens in ways that are wholly unique from the mundane. Complex Forms require the Threading skill to make use of them.
	
	Unlike much of Decking, Complex Forms and other Resonance powers tend to target non-standard attributes. While Decking tends to be contested computer skill rolls, these can often be contested with Will or HT of targets, which can sometimes be pure software! 
	
	Usually, in such cases the power indicates what those rolls should be for most targets, but here are some general rules for it as well: HT Resistance rolls are for resisting brutish attempts and damage to hardware and software, while Will is for subversion and manipulation. HT is the same as in the basic set, ranging from 8 for cheap designs, 10 for average designs, 12 for rugged designs, and 14 for very rugged designs. Meanwhile, Will is usually either the Will of the owner for the device or software or alternatively the Complexity $\times$ 2 of the Software or the Device.
	
	Explicitly, \textbf{none} of these powers take Complexity as a penalty to their roll (as seen in Psionic Powers and Technomysticism)! The math behind it \textit{does not} work out well, and ends up being \textit{much} more punishing in comparison to normal contested Power versus Will rolls!
	
	\paragraph{Threading}\label{threading}
	\begin{flushright}
		\textbf{10/Hard}
	\end{flushright}
	\textcolor{NavyBlue}{\textit{Defaults: None}}
	
	Threading allows a Technomancer or Otaku to manipulate the Resonance of the Matrix in order to create wholly unique effects inside of them called Complex Forms.
	
	When threading a Complex Form, you must first select a Level for it, which can range from 1 - 2\(\times\)Resonance. The higher the Level, the more powerful the Complex Form, but the more Fading you must resist. Fading is the strain put on your body due to the laborous process of Threading. It costs 1 FP per Level, up to your Resonance, after which it instead costs 1 HP per Level.
	
	You can resist Fading by rolling against (IQ+Will)/2, reducing the amount of FP or HP fading by your Margin of Success.
	
	Many Complex Forms provide resistance rolls for systems. When these systems are manned, they usually use the Attributes and Skills of their owners. When unmanned, the GM may decide whether they benefit from the owner's attributes or not, given that they would be configured by them after all. If they are, it usually will be at a penalty for being unable to react. For unmanned systems, they usually have a Will of Complexity\(\times\)2.
	
	\subsubsection*{Editor}\label{editor}
	
	The Emerged is able to interface with a file and read its contents without having to necessarily break through ICE or encryption.
	
	To do so, roll a Quick Contest of Threading + Resonance versus Will of the File (That of the device it's housed on, usually Complexity $\times$ 2). Success allows the Emerged to read text, listen to audio, watch media, or engage with any for of media that the file contains - however it is explicitly read only, unable to execute or write!
	
	This form bypasses even encryption and ciphers, able to translate them to meaning for the Emerged to understand, effectively rendering them useless; some particularly well encrypted or high Complexity files can improve the resistance roll of the file by up to +3.
	
	At the second level, the Emerged is able to even write and execute the file itself. This requires 10 minutes of Concentration ended with a Quick Contest of Threading + Resonance versus Will of the File, with a -1 penalty per file already under your control. Success allows the Emerged to write and execute the file freely (Although this is separate from being able to read from it).
	
	The Emerged can edit the file as long as their Concentration is maintained, and afterwards for one minute per margin of success.
	
	Failure however, locks the Emerged out of the file for 24 hours and can alert sysadmins or programs watching it that something unusual has happened, and that your account was involved (But not what was attempted or any further information about it), which is usually enough for investigation, but not raising the alarms. On a Critical Failure, the Emerged also loses control of \textit{every other file} controlled by this power, or must check against crippling if there are no others.
	
	At higher Levels (The Level of the Complex Form being Threaded, not the power itself), both powers become easier to use, gaining a +1 bonus per Level past the first.

	\subsubsection*{Pulse Storm}\label{pulse_storm}
	
	The Emerged cause a veil of Resonance to surround his target on the Matrix, jamming incoming and outgoing radio signals to them.
	
	To do so, roll a Quick Contest of Threading versus Will (Usually Complexity $\times$ 2 for devices). Success gives a penalty to all radio communications going to or from the target to take a -1 penalty per Level. This explicitly affects attempts to interface with that device alongside its attempts to interface outwards - so long as that is done through wireless radio communication.
	
	This power affects all bands of Radio communication, including things such as GPS, Gridguide, and so on. As well, the power's existence isn't detectable through mundane means, simply showing up as dropped packets, random increase in latency, or strangely bad signal. Additionally, when threaded it cannot be detected by any mundane means either.

	\subsubsection*{Resonance Spike}\label{resonance_spike}
	
	The Emerged is able to induce overheating and physical damage in devices by suffusing them with a spike of Resonance energy.
	
	Roll a Quick Contest of Threading + Resonance versus the computer's HT (+3 for Hardened systems). If the Emerged wins, the computer takes 1d burning surge damage per Level. This form notably cannot be used to target living beings on the devices using VR, although it can have knock on effects!
	
	Highly powerful hits can have additional effects. Dealing over 1/3 of HP causes the system to start short, requiring an immediate HT roll (+3 for Hardened systems). Failure disables the device for seconds equal to Margin of failure; critical failure disables it until repaired. For living beings, this simply affects the devices they are on, which can prevent jacking out, performing actions, or even dumpshock. As well, critical success on the Threading roll also disables the device until repaired.
	
	Additionally, there is nothing subtle about this power. Although the target may not understand what Resonance is, it is patently obvious that you have attempted a loud and violent attack, in a similar fashion to seeing a firearm being shot.

	\subsubsection*{Static Bomb}\label{static_bomb}
	
	The Emerged is able to interfere with an icon's ability to track their Living Persona over a network or computer.
	
	Success on a Threading + Resonance roll provides a -1 penalty per level to attempts to detection or maintain detection of the Living Persona, lasting for 1 minute until the Emerged must roll again. The power itself is undetectable to mundane means, simply hiding or altering their presence, or blinding or altering traffic towards them if necessary. This even affects indirect detection methods on the matrix, such as measuring traffic load going through a network, detecting read/write counts on a disk, or increased usage of wireless interface cards - it however does not affect any physical direct or indirect methods, such as listening to computer active, sounds or other media that a computer might play, or so on.
	
	While this power does not affect the Emerged's use of the network, it does affect allied attempts to locate them, which can cause things such as dropped or unreachable calls, unintentional disconnecting from team comms or TacNets, or simple attempts to find them on the Matrix. When in doubt, the GM should be within their rights to cause small hiccups and time delays for extended usage of the power.
	
	At Level 10, the Emerged is invisible to detection, although the penalty \textit{can} increase higher, for dealing with edge cases or opponents who negate penalties.

	\subsubsection*{Wiretap}\label{wiretap}
	
	The Emerged gains the ability to monitor all of the data flowing in, out, and throughout of a system, without needing to break past its ICE.
	
	To do so, Concentrate for one second and roll a Quick Contest of Threading + Resonance versus the system's Will (Usually, Complexity $\times$ 2). Success lets the Emerged monitor the device's ingoing, outgoing, or internal traffic over wireless or wired connections, see any commands input (including everything input through a terminal or VR interface), notice when a program starts or ends, see any outputs from displays or other devices, and anything suitably similar. 
	
	The Emerged can only view data that in unprotected and in standard formats, such as text, video, audio, databases, etc. Anything that is encrypted or ciphered is unable to be interpreted, but can be streamed to a separate device for later decryption.
	
	At higher Levels, the power becomes easier to use, providing a +1 bonus per Level past the first.

\subsection{Sprites}

Sprites are strange denizens of the Matrix, believed to be formed out of or summoned from the Resonance Realms. They are able to compiled and given form by the Emerged in order to assist them with tasks on the Matrix. Sprites take a variety of shapes, largely influenced by the Emerged's sense of design when compiling them, although they do tend to associate themselves towards certain categories of skills and therefore matching aesthetics.

In game, Sprites are summoned using the Compiling and Registering advantages. Their templates down below are used to calculate their cost as Allies, all of which must have the Appears Constantly, Special Abilities, Summonable, and Favor modifiers.

Because there is not a set point limit for any campaign, the costs are as follows, with a pre-built system for 100 and 200 points.

\subsubsection{Sprite Meta-Trait}
\begin{flushright}
	59 Points
\end{flushright}

All Sprites share some fundamental qualties that are present in their Sprite meta-trait. While there is still incredible diversity between Sprites, and even less known about their nature than Spirits, there is at least some fundamental similarities between them that can be nailed down.

\textbf{Attributes}
ST 0 [-100]

\textbf{Advantages:}
Absolute Time [2]; Digital Mind [5]; Doesn't Breath [20]; Doesn't Eat or Drink [10]; Doesn't Sleep [10]; Telecommunication, Telesend (Full Communion, +20\%; Accessibility, Summoner Only, -80\%; Complex Form, -5\%) [11]; Unaging (IQ Only, -75\%) [4]; Unusual Background (Sprite) [5]

\textbf{Disadvantages:}

\textbf{Perks:}
Console-Monkey [1]

\subsubsection{Sprite Level}\label{sprite_level}
\begin{flushright}
	5 Points
\end{flushright}

As a Sprite increases in Level, its powers increase alongside. This comes with a number of mandatory traits that are automatically applied and \textit{do not} count towards any CP bonuses per Level.

\textbf{Advantages:}
Resonance [5]

\subsection{List of Sprites}

This is a list of templates for known Sprites types. TODO: Description of system as seen in Spirits (It's the same system, but I want it here as well!)

\subsubsection{Courier Sprite}
\begin{flushright}
	 -34 Points Level 0
\end{flushright}

Specialized for the transfer and manipulating of media, the Courier Sprite often is tasked with finding, moving, and protecting valuable paydata for an Emerged. Their forms vary wildly as with all Sprites, but often take the form of physical data carriers such as mailmen, radio antennae, etc. or alternatively digital systems well known for communication, such as e-mail icons, wi-fi or ethernet symbols, or so on.

They fulfill an interesting middle-ground in many capabilities, able to break into and acquire data in a variety of systems, while still being relatively durable. Their powers are useful outside normal operations as well, being able to hide or gather data without much recourse.

\textbf{Attributes:} -144

\subsubsection{Crack Sprite}
\begin{flushright}
	-61 Points Level 0
\end{flushright}

The Crack Sprite is the born hacker of all Sprites. Specializing in stealthy infiltration of systems, they're very competent at hacking, although that is countered by their relative fragility. They come in many forms, like all sprites, but are heavily influenced by the hacker, l33t, and punk cultures of the Emerged, taking the form of various hackers, malware snippets, or simply stealth and/or threatening imagery.

Their ability to suppress detection can prove invaluable, especially when combined with an Emerged's own capabilities, making it very difficult to notice their intrusion and react in time.

\textbf{Attributes:} -171
DX -3 [-75]; IQ 9 [-15]; HT 6 [-60]
Will 7 [-21]; Per 8 [-10]; Basic Speed 4.25 [10]

\textbf{Advantages:} 78

\subsubsection{Data Sprite}
\begin{flushright}
	-62 Points Level 0
\end{flushright}

Masters of data collection and manipulation, Data Sprites specialize in general purpose computing and specialized data analysis and storage. While not strictly impressive in base capabilities, their wide selection of skills and powers make up for this shortcoming. Their forms tend towards intellectual stereotypes, whether that be office works or "nerds", mathematical tools or iconography, or simple base concepts such as numbers.

Their ability to hide files and leave messages are nigh undetectable and can be extremely useful in the hands of a creative Emerged, allowing for extremely sophisticated and hard to detect messaging systems, even under a corp's own nose!

\textbf{Attributes:} -181
DX -3 [-75]; IQ 6 [-60]; HT 7 [-45]
Will 7 [-21]; Per 10 [0]; Basic Speed 4.50 [20]

\textbf{Advantages:} 91

\subsubsection{Fault Sprite}
\begin{flushright}
	-22 Points Level 0
\end{flushright}

The brute among them all, the Fault Sprite specialized in loud and quick intrusion to a device or network. Their already impressive base capabilities are further enhanced by their largely unique skillsets, able to assist with almost any overt hacking possible. Their forms are perhaps some of the most varied among all sprites, ranging from stereotypical barbarians and brutes, to skilled swordsman and samurai, even to icons representing forces of nature or immovable objects.

Their ability to inflict long lasting, cyclic damage should not be underestimated as well, giving them the capabilities to slowly whittle down even the most durable systems given time.

\textbf{Attributes:} -143
DX -3 [-75]; IQ 9 [-15]; HT 9 [-15]

\subsubsection{Machine Sprite}
\begin{flushright}
	-65 Points Level 0
\end{flushright}

The most unique Sprite of them all, the Machine Sprite specializes in physical hardware and circuitry, unlike its other software based cousins. This both gives it improved capabilities when it comes to meatspace, being more dextrous and capable of using mediums such as drones. These take a very wide variety of forms, ranging from generic machines or well known brands or types, to stereotypical iconography such as gears and wrenches.

Their powers are extraordinarily useful outside of hacking encounters, allowing for increased performance of critical hardware, spontaneous glitches and issues for enemy hardware, or simply preventing unlikely issues for hardware under its control.

\textbf{Attributes:} -149
