\section{Resonance}

\begin{multicols*}{3}
	
	\subsection{Resonance Power}
	
	Resonance is a power that allows users to manipulate computer software using - to the best of metahumanity's determination - just their mind. Emerged users, while focused in differing specialties, all have the ability to interface with the Matrix and computers via radio waves believed to be generated by their mind, generally referred to as their Living Persona.
	
	How they do so is still up to series debate, even after the inhumane experiments done by corporations like Horizon, ranging from a special, Matrix derived Metaplane, to the ghost of hundreds of dead Technomancers, to the gestalt consciousness of humanity, to the inhumane influence of the true AIs.
	
	Whatever the reason, Technomancers are (apparently) here to stay now, unlike their predecessors the Otaku, and their capabilities are not to be taken lightly.
	
	For most intents and purposes, a Living Persona seems to work like a normal computer or datajack that lacks media storage. It can be jammed, hacked, shut off, execute programs on other computers, perform VR, be stopped by lead paint, etc. 
	
	However, some resonance based powers called Complex Forms seem to only partially play by the rules of the Matrix. These powers cannot be jammed, hacked, etc., unlike their cousin abilities for the Emerged. As long as the user can make any connection to a computer, these abilities can be used regardless of the mundane circumstances. This is somewhat limited however by the fact that Complex Forms tend to be reliant on other abilities that \textit{are} susceptible to these effect, and by the dangerous Fading that Emerged receive when using such powers.
	
	As such, there are two power modifiers that are used for Resonance (both of which Resonance improves the abilities of):
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Resonance, -15\%; (Mundane Countermeasures, -10\%; Supernatural Countermeasures, -5\%)
		\item Complex Form, -5\%; (Supernatural Countermeasures, -5\%)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Emerged Types}
	
	\paragraph{Emerged}
	\begin{flushright}
		27 Points
	\end{flushright}
	
	An Emerged character, colloquially known as Technomancers - or many years ago Otaku, although it is still up to debate whether they are one and the same - has the ability to manifest a Living Persona and connect to computers using only their brain.
	
	This meta-trait allows you to communicate using Radio on \textit{any and all} standard communication frequencies used for the Matrix. This is somewhat more expansive than a normal computer, including cases such as AM/FM Radio, GPS and Satellite, etc. To do so, make a Concentrate maneuver and succeed a Computer Operation + Resonance  to establish a communication link. For certain secure boxes, this may require some scanning or detection to determine in what ways they will even begin to communicate! It's also possible to maintain multiple contacts, with a cumulative -1 to the roll for each contact past the first.
	
	However, it does not include communication with radio in ways and frequencies not used for Matrix communication, such as Radar and other detection formats, certain types of navigation and obtuse communications, etc. When in doubt, most radio communication systems should be included by the GM.
	
	Your ability has a range of 2 miles, although it can connect to further locations by hopping along networks (As normal computers do), so it only has to be in range of a computer or network that can pass along the data (Which, given the ubiquity of wireless computers in the Sixth World, is not very hard outside of a Z Zone).
	
	You can transfer information in any format, encoding, and so on - although this does not grant you the ability to read formats that are protected, such as encryption and ciphers. As well, you may transfer any information from your senses in such a way.
	
	The communication is also secure, preventing any spying or eavesdropping unless the opponent wins a quick contest of IQ (only if using Telecommunication, such as with this power) or Electronics Operation (Surveillance) versus your IQ or Expert Skill (Cybersecurity), adding any Resonance to either rolls.
	
	Additionally, while on the Matrix, the user counts as a digital consciousness - which is to say their brain acts like a computer. This allows the Emerged to interact with the Matrix as if they were a computer themselves. For game purposes, they have a Complexity equal to 3 + Resonance.
	
	Their Matrix minds are immune to Mind Control or any telepathic powers alongside spells that affect living minds, however they can be hacked, damaged, taken offline, and more by digital threats and viruses (Although not reprogrammed, they lack that disadvantage!). 
	
	Unlike AI, the Technomancer can only run on their own mind, unable to duplicate, backup, or transfer their digital minds between machines - although they can still move around and interact with hosts and networks as normal. They are unable to actually reside inside (read: possess) computers like riggers (without a specific Submersion) or AI, so they both do not immediately gain control of resident systems, nor are trapped inside them should their matrix connectivity be shut off, they function like a deck would - lose connection to the host it was currently "inside" and interacting with, which can still be damaging!
	
	While his normal ways of interacting with the Matrix are complex and intuitive enough to count as Basic VR, the Technomancer is also able to enter a trancelike state to enter the Matrix at any time, exactly as if using Total VR.
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Statistics: Digital Mind (Accessibility, Only on Matrix, -40\%) [5]; Telecommunication, Radio (Requires (Computer Operation), +5\%; Secure, +20\%, Sensie, +80\%; Accessibility (Only frequencies used for Matrix), -20\%; Reduced Range, x1/5, -20\%; Resonance, -15\%) [15]; Unsusual Background [5]; Accessory, Total VR (Cosmic, Does not take program slots, +50\%; Cosmic, Ignores Complexity limits, +50\%) [2]\footnote{See the Resonance Program advantage below as an example of how this works.}}}
	
	\subsection{Using a Living Persona}
	
	Emerged's consciousness represent themselves  on the Matrix as living persona. These can take almost any form possible, and often tend to be more intricate, detailed, realistic, or so on compared to other icons on the matrix (Although not enough to reliably distinguish them). 
	
	Their persona allows them to exist on the matrix in the same way as a Commlink or similar device, with their Living Persona acting as their icons on the wider Matrix. They are also able to perform any standard actions expected of a computer with wireless capabilities, be it searching, communicating, browsing the Matrix, writing and editing files, executing programs, and so on. 
	
	Their Persona lacks any media storage, which makes them unable to physically store files, paydata, programs, and so on. However, they can easily stream data from one source to a device of theirs, such as a commlink. This does however, mean that they are unable to innately perform hacking actions using the GURPS \#3/21 - Cyberpunk hacking programs, as they would only be able to execute them through other computers be default.
	
	The standard way to run hacking (or any programs, should the technomancer wish to run DOOM in his brain!), is to purchase the \hyperref[resonance_program]{Resonance Program advantage} from below, which allows him to run the program as if installed on his Digital Mind.
	
	Secondly, most Complex Forms and the Technomancer's Emerged trait double up as programs for the use of one or more hacking programs (The GM is encouraged to consider their use for non-hacking programs too, such as Puppeteer being used for IT Remote Desktop software). These restrictions are taken, but altered from Pyramid \#3/91 - Thaumatology IV, which is further described in \hyperref[behind_the_screen]{the Behind the Screen section on Resonance.}

	\subsection{Resonance Advantages}
	
	\paragraph{Resonance}
	\textit{Prerequisite: Emerged}
	\begin{flushright}
		5 Points / Level
	\end{flushright}
	
	Resonance is the core for your unnatural abilities as an Emerged. Add your Resonance to all rolls to use \textbf{Complex Forms} well; this means all Complex Form skills, activation rolls, etc. As well, the GM should look for ways to apply a bonus indirectly to passive abilities, as described in GURPS Supers p22.
	
	Your Resonance also serves as a cap for various resonance advantages: For Threading, Compiling, and Registering, you can only buy Levels up to your Resonance level.
	
	When purchasing resonance advantages, you must only pay full cost for your most expensive Complex Form; for all other ones you pay only 1/5 cost. However, you can only sustain one Complex Form at a given time (although you may have multiple instances of that Complex Form if applicable); if you want to sustain multiple different effects, you must pay full price for each of your next most expensive Complex Form for the amount of additional effects you wish to sustain.
	
	When threading Complex Forms, you must make two Concentrate maneuvers (or only one, if the last Complex Form used is the same one).

	\end{flushright}

	The Technomancer is able to run a specific program through his Living Persona as if it were a normal computer. It can be run at any complexity from its minimum up to the complexity of their Persona (3 + Resonance), chosen when loaded.
	
	The Technomancer is still subject to computer restrictions like normal, including Complexity limiting the amount of programs they can run, interface modes affecting skill levels, programs needing to be invoked, and so on.
	
	Many Technomancer advantages provide the corresponding Resonance Program advantage for free (as shown above), including all the benefits as seen here; the Technomancer should only purchase this for programs that they do not have corresponding advantages for.

	\subsection{Complex Forms}
	
	\subsubsection{Using Complex Forms}
	
	Complex Forms are one of the secret spices to an Emerged's capabilities, allowing them to interact with the Matrix and its denizens in ways that are wholly unique from the mundane. Complex Forms require the Threading skill to make use of them:
	
	\paragraph{Threading}
	\begin{flushright}
		\textbf{10/Hard}
	\end{flushright}
	\textcolor{NavyBlue}{\textit{Defaults: None}}
	
	Threading allows a Technomancer or Otaku to manipulate the Resonance of the Matrix in order to create wholly unique effects inside of them called Complex Forms.
	
	When threading a Complex Form, you must first select a Level for it, which can range from 1 - 2\(\times\)Resonance. The higher the Level, the more powerful the Complex Form, but the more Fading you must resist. Fading is the strain put on your body due to the laborous process of Threading. It costs 1 FP per Level, up to your Resonance, after which it instead costs 1 HP per Level.
	
	You can resist Fading by rolling against (IQ+Will)/2, reducing the amount of FP or HP fading by your Margin of Success.
	
	Many Complex Forms provide resistance rolls for systems. When these systems are manned, they usually use the Attributes and Skills of their owners. When unmanned, the GM may decide whether they benefit from the owner's attributes or not, given that they would be configured by them after all. If they are, it usually will be at a penalty for being unable to react. For unmanned systems, they usually have a Will of Complexity\(\times\)2.
