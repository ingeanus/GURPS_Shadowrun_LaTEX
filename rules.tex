\section{Rules}

\begin{multicols*}{3}
	
	Due to the nature of Shadowrun's setting, a variety of source books and optional rules are specifically used, alongside some suggested Home Rules (Which are incorporated into the statistics of this ruleset).
	
	\subsection{Books and Optional Rules}
	
	\paragraph{GURPS Basic Set}
	The core rules.
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em 
		\item Limited Enhancements (BS111): Used in creating complex advantages like Magic.
		\item Malfunction (BS279)
		\item Extra Effort in Combat (BS357): Both increases competency and survive-ability in combat.
		\item Dual-Weapon Attacks (BS417)
		\item Bleeding (BS420): Lasting threat from damage that requires stabilization.
		\item Random Hits: Gunfire should default to Random Hit Locations in order to reduce its general lethality.
		\item Critical Hit Tables
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{GURPS Gun-Fu:}
	Gun-Fu is an integral part of much of the near-Wuxia styles of combat present in Shadowrun and its slice of Cyberpunk culture. Much of GURPS Gun-Fu however is \textbf{too} cinematic, portraying a John Wu film style. As a general rule, Tactical Shooting is the better source to go to, but Gun-Fu's Perks, Styles, and non-cinematic Skills, Techniques, and Advantages are all great sources for Gunbunnies. Seek GM approval for anything from this book however.
	
	\paragraph{GURPS High Tech}
	GURPS High-Tech provides much of the technology for the setting.
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em 
		\item Drawing Your Weapon (HT81): Provides bonuses for the many places one can hide their weapon.
		\item Stopping the Bleeding (HT162): Makes first-aid more important for certain hit locations.
		\item "You Shot Me, Mister!" (HT162): Usually only for goons and grunts.
		\item Explosions in Enclosed Spaces (HT181): Chunky Salsa returns.
		\item Side Effects of Explosions (HT181)
		\item Explosive Destruction of Materiel (HT182)
		\item Sheaths (HT198)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{GURPS Low Tech}
	GURPS Low Tech holds a variety of rules useful for all tech levels, such as tools, rules regarding armor and its effects, low tech armor at higher TLs, etc.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em 
		\item Armor Fatigue (LT101)
		\item Chinks in Armor (LT101)
		\item Harsh Realism - Armor Gaps (LT101)
		\item Concealing Armor (LT102)
		\item Donning Armor (LT102)
		\item Blunt Trauma and Edged Weapons (LT102): This one is highly up to the GM. It makes cut much less effective against armored targets, but makes it very hard to make it completely uneffective due to blunt trauma. As well, it is fittingly realistic.
		\item Layered Armor (LT103)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{GURPS Martial Arts}
	Martial Arts is the bread and butter for Street Samurai and Combat Adepts. It's more likely that something is used from this book than not.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em 
		\item Expanded Combat Maneuvers (MA96)
		\item Limiting Multiple Dodges (MA123)
		\item Extreme Dismemberment (MA136)
		\item New Hit Locations (MA137)
		\item Pain in Close Combat
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{GURPS Tactical Shooting}
	GURPS Tactical Shooting in general is recommended for providing depth and flavour to a variety of gunfighter styles, alongside providing a multitude of interesting and useful skills and techniques.
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em 
		\item Using The Sights (TS13): Provides good definitions on what each maneuver implies when firing.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{GURPS Social Engineering}
	GURPS Social Engineering is the bread and butter for Faces and Social Infiltrators. While the rules are not necessary to run even social focused characters, almost every non-cinematic rule is extremely fitting for such characters.
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em 
		\item Expanded Influence Rolls (SE31)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{GURPS Ultra Tech}
	Ultra Tech provides much of the tech for the setting of Shadowrun. \textbf{However}, much of it is entirely out of place in the setting. See \hyperref[TL]{the Tech Level section} for more clarification on what technology available
	
	\paragraph{GURPS Pyramid \#3/34 - Alternate GURPS 1}
	
	\begin{itemize} 
		\itemsep0em 
		\item Do-or-Die Bullet Dodging
		\item He Who Hesitates
		\item Grazes
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{GURPS Pyramid \#3/55 - Military Sci-Fi}
	Provides a wide variety of equipment that is of plenty of interest to runners. Importantly, updates some of Ultratech's equipment to bring it in line with the standards of High-Tech and Tactical Shooting.
	
	\paragraph{GURPS Pyramid \#3/65 - Alternate GURPS 3}
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em 
		\item A Full Complement
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{GURPS Pyramid \#3/85 - Cutting Edge}
	Has a great set of perks for all matrix specialist to use! 
	
	The GM is recommended to follow the restriction of 1 perk per 10 points in related matrix skills, although can easily expand the default list to include skills such as Cryptography.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em 
		\item The Perky L33t, with perks allowed for non H4xx0rs.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\paragraph{GURPS Power-Ups 3: Talents}
	This book provides many useful Talents that can be used by characters in order to fill their niche as a runner. Due to the attribute repricing (See \hyperref[PU9]{Power-Ups 9}), these are much more useful for specializing a character.
	
	\paragraph{GURPS Power-Ups 9: Alternate Attributes \label{PU9}}
	GURPS Power-Ups 9 details a system for pricing attributes accordingly to a campaign's setting and assumptions. I have gone through and implemented the rules here in order to provide better costs for the game. 
	
	Accordingly, all templates, lenses, equipment, etc. incorporate them; if you do not wish to include them into your games remember to re-calculate the points costs where necessary.
	
	For in-depth details on the choices for the prices, see \hyperref[behind_the_screen]{the Behind the Screen section}; in brief: Reducing ST costs to compete with small arms, Increasing DX and IQ costs to match and compete with Talents, Increasing HT costs to be balanced, and Increasing Will and FP costs to account for Magic and Extra Effort.
	
	\noindent\textbf{Strength}
	7 Points / Level
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em 
		\item Hit Points - 2 Points / Level
		\item Striking ST - 3 Points / Level
		\item Lifting ST - 2 Points / Level
		\item Arm ST - 2, 3, or 4 Points / Level
	\end{itemize}
	
	\noindent\textbf{Dexterity}
	25 Points / Level
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em 
		\item +0.25 Basic Speed - 5 Points / Level
		\item Arm DX - 12 or 16 point / Level
	\end{itemize}

	\paragraph{GURPS Social Engineering - Keeping Contact}
	
	This book is extensively used for Contact creation and rules. It is covered in more detail in \hyperref[Contacts]{the Contact Section.}
	
	\subsection{Home Rules}
	
	\textbf{Critical Hits \& Active Defenses:} When a critical hit is rolled on an attack, the opponent can still make active defense rolls at an additional -4.
	
	\textbf{Arm DX and ST:} These are priced by their absolute value (DX without Basic Speed and ST without HP).
	
	\textbf{Costs FP and HP:} The first level of these limitations costs double (-10\% and -20\% respectively).
	
	\textbf{Extra Effort in Combat:} An unmodified Will roll is required to gain the benefits of the Extra Effort. The FP is still spent on a failure.
	
	\subsection{Character Creation}
	
	A number of rules or guidelines are necessary to prevent characters from being built that do not in any way fit the setting. Like always, the GM should exercises their best judgement when banning psionic aliens from the table, but a list of helpful points are also included:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep 0pt
		\item Characters should seek approval for attribute levels in excess of \(\pm\)30\% of Racial baselines, and levels in excess of \(\pm\)50\% should generally not be allowed.
		\item Characters should seek approval for wealth levels of Wealthy [20] and above. Very Wealth [30] should be highly scrutinized as it's extremely efficient for purchasing 'ware. If allowed, consider enforcing the 80\% settled lifestyle rules (B26) in order to prevent abuse.
		\item Independant Income should generally be banned, or at a minimum greatly limited.
		\item Multiple advantages or enhancements from differing sources should generally not stack. As an example, DR from Adept Powers and DR from Cyberware, should generally be highly scrutinized by the GM, in order to avoid cases that break the game's norms (Or at least, without an Unusual Background!). A good sanity test is to limit levels to be equal or less to a guiding attribute, such as HT or Will.
		\item Any enhancement for Affects Substantial/Insubstantial, or that which allows effects to cross planes, is strictly banned.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Talents}
	
	Talents are heavily recommended, especially the Alternative Talents from Power-Ups 3, which provide excellent flavor and utility. 
	
	Talent Levels are limited to 4, with the exception being Talents from special sources, including 'Ware, Magic, and Resonance, which are limited to 6 at character creation, but may be taken higher with permission by the GM.
	
	\subsubsection{High Basic Speed}\label{high_basic_speed}
	
	The extreme capabilities of many pieces of 'ware and adept powers unlock the ability to purchase a variety of advantages that are usually unavailable to characters (in the exact same way as with unusual backgrounds).
	
	Characters with a Basic Speed of 7.0 or above (whether through 'ware, magic, or natural ability) can purchase the Extra Attack - up to three times for Basic Speed 8.0 and 9.0 - as detailed below for Cyberware, or Bioware, orMundanes respectively.
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Statistics: Extra Attack (Multi-Strike, +20\%) with Power (Technological), -35\%, Power (Bioware), -5\%; Magical, -10\%; or no Power modifier. These cost 22, 29, 28, and 30 points respectively.}}
	
	For individuals with switchable Basic Speed (Such as Wired Reflexes) that takes them above the necessary, they may add \textit{Accessibility, Basic Speed limited, -5\%\footnote{Priced according to assumption that you will use in ~90\% of combat situations.}}, costing 20, 28, 27, and 29 points respectively.
	
	Optionally, a GM may allow the purchase of Altered Time Rate for characters with Basic Speed of 8.0 or more, as detailed below:
	
	\textit{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Statistics: Altered Time Rate 1 with Power (Technological), -35\%, Power (Bioware), -5\%; Magical, -10\%; or no Power modifier. These cost 65, 95, 90, and 100 points respectively.}}
	
	For individuals with switchable Basic Speed (Such as Wired Reflexes) that takes them above the necessary, they may add \textit{Accessibility, Basic Speed limited, -15\%\footnote{Priced according to assumption that you can benefit from ATR at all times, but will activate ~67\%}}, costing 50, 80, 75, and 85 points respectively. 
	
	It is not recommended to allow these Extra Attack and ATR together, as their effects are multiplicative and may prove destabilising even despite the prohibitive costs.
